# NLP-Mini-Project-22

The aim of my project is to analyse a text corpus of Twin Peaks scripts (season one) I discovered on Kaggle.
I will be analysing the frequency of certain words within the scripts.
I will visualise using bar charts through matplotlib.
I will then analyse bigrams and trigrams. 
In my essay, I have conducted further semantic analysis.
