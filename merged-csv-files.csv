INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Welcome to Twin Peaks. My name is Margaret Lantermen. I live in Twin Peaks. I am known as the log lady. There is a story behind that. There are many stories in Twin Peaks. Some of them are sad, some funny. Some are stories of madness, of violence. Some are ordinary. Yet they all have about them a sense of mystery. The mystery of life, sometimes the mystery of death. The mystery of the woods, the woods surrounding Twin Peaks. To introduce this story let me just say it encompasses the all. It is beyond the fire. Though few would know that meaning. It is a story of many but it begins with one and I knew her. The one leading to the many is Laura Palmer. Laura is the one.

BENJAMIN
Are they ready to sign?

LELAND
Are you not even going to mention that we have not as yet acquired access to the Packard land?

BENJAMIN hocks a loogey and spits it into the fire causing it to spark and crackle. LELAND turns away at the sight of this.

BENJAMIN
Sorry. (clears his throat) We have solid information. The Packard Saw Mill is going to go belly up within a year. We are going to able to get it for a song, one verse no chorus. Now let's get out there and get those cheese eaters where they live.

LELAND
Uhhh, Benjamin.

BENJAMIN HORNE is animatedly speaking to Norwegian businessmen. Sitting beside him is a translator that is interpreting his selling speech.

BENJAMIN
Clean, wholesome environment much like your very own. (translator speaks) With a quality of life to rival the very best. (translations) That this country has to offer and that is what the Ghostwood Country Club and Estates will be. Now, when I first spoke to Sven he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air. If you permit me Sven (motioning to SVEN JORGENSON) to repeat what you told me after your run, 'my air sacks (Ben breathes in deeply and pounds his chest on the exhale) have never felt so good.'

After the translation the crowd laughs.

JULIE, a hotel employee, approaches LELAND and whispers.

JULIE
Your wife's on the phone again. She says its urgent.

In the background the translator is speaking to the crowd in Norwegian and again the crowd laughs.

BOBBY
You heading out Shelly.

SHELLY
Yeah, I'm heading home.

BOBBY
I'm going to practice. I can drop you by your place on the way.

SHELLY looks at NORMA. NORMA is already looking at her, studying her expression.

SHELLY
That'd be great thanks.

BOBBY pays in loose change tossed on the counter. On the way out he approaches the jukebox.

BOBBY
Here's a tune for you gals. (places a coin in the jukebox) Okay, Norma. (points to NORMA) I'll see you in my dreams.

SHELLY
And what stage are we in now?

BOBBY

CATHERINE
Do you hear me! You can't do that to my workers. Don't walk away from me like that! Come on back here! Your not going anywhere and your not going to tell anybody anything.

JOSIE and CATHERINE enter the office. JOSIE turns around to face CATHERINE and says...

JOSIE
Catherine, I'm sorry if this offends you but I am the owner of this saw mill.

CATHERINE
And you don't know the first thing about this mill. That's why I'm running it.

JOSIE
I've never taken this authority before but maybe I should have.

CATHERINE
Your not shutting us down.

JOSIE
Catherine, I have the final say-so. Peter push the plug.

CATHERINE
Pete, don't you dare.

PETE has been watching the confrontation between both women.

PETE
Oh, Catherine. Please (walks over to the phone, picks it up) Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug. (response) That's right.

COOPER
Diane, 11:30 am, February 24. Entering the town of Twin Peaks, five miles South of the Canadian border, twelve miles West of the state line. I've never seen so many trees in my life. As W. C. Fields would say I'd rather be here then in Philadelphia. Fifty-four degrees on a slightly overcast day. Weatherman said rain. If you get paid that kind of money for being wrong sixty percent of the time it beat working. My mileage is 79,345. Gauge is on reserve. Riding on fumes here. I've got to tank up when I get into town. Remind me to tell you how much that is. Lunch was ... uhh ... (retrieves a receipt from his pocket) six dollars and thirty-one cents at the ... Lamplighter Inn, that's on highway two near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat, slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee. (emphasized) Damn good food. Diane, if you ever get up this way that cherry pie is worth a stop. Okay. (picks up card) Looks like I'll be meeting up with a ahh ... Sheriff Harry S. Truman. Shouldn't be to hard to remember that. That will be at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital. I guess we're going to go up to intensive care and take a look at that girl that crawled down the railroad tracks off the mountain. I'm pretty sure I'll be checking into a hotel. I'm sure the sheriff will be able to recommend a clean place, reasonably priced. That's what I need, clean place, reasonably priced.

COOPER
Dale Cooper, FBI (shakes hands). Pleasure.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good to meet you.

COOPER clears his throat and they both proceed to walk up the hall.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Have any trouble finding the place?

COOPER
No, no trouble to find. I came out over Highway Two near Lewis Fork. I stopped at a little place called the Lamplighter Inn, had a slice of cherry pie, incredible.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well I'll tell ya' we're sure glad to have the FBI here. We're kinda lucky in the way that Ronette step out across the state line. The whole town is very badly shaken up.

COOPER
Yeah, sure its a nice quiet place, something like this. (stops TRUMAN in the hall, now face to face) Sheriff let me just talk to you in the hallway here for just a second. There's a few things we got to get straight right off the bat. Now I've learned about this the hard way, its best to talk about it up front. When the bureau gets called in, the bureau's in charge. Now your going to be working for me. Sometimes local law enforcement has a problem with that. I hope you understand.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Like I said, we're glad to have you here.

COOPER now moves a little closer to SHERIFF TRUMAN and sports a grin.

COOPER
Sheriff, what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing around here? Big, majestic.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Douglas firs.

COOPER
(repeated in amazement) Douglas firs. (changes expression) Can someone give me a copy of the coroner's report on the dead girl.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well the autopsy hasn't been done yet. But I'll take you down stairs to the morgue when we're finished here.

COOPER
Fine.

DR. SHELVY
Several times.

COOPER
One perpetrator?

DR. SHELVY
We're waiting for the results.

COOPER
(turns around to SHERIFF TRUMAN) Any connection to the dead girl?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Same high school. As far as we know they hardly knew each other. No connection.

COOPER
Hmm. I'd like to question her.

DR. SHELVY
This girl doesn't even know where she is or if she is.

COOPER
What exactly are you saying?

DR. SHELVY
We need a CAT scan and we are not equipped for that here. My opinion, she may have neurological damage. She's just not responsive at all.

COOPER
I'd like to examine her fingers?

DR. SHELVY looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN with a puzzled look. SHERIFF TRUMAN shrugs and gives a blank stare.

DR. SHELVY
All right.

COOPER moves over to RONETTE and grabs her left hand. With a small magnifying glass he looks at her fingernails.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
They've already scrapped for particles.

COOPER
Nah. That's not what I'm looking for. (continues looking) No, no. There's nothing here. Not a thing.

As COOPER puts her hand down RONETTE mumbles.

RONETTE
No. No. Don't go there. Don't ... don't go there.

DR. JACOBY stands quietly with his hands in his pockets and with large ear plugs in his ears. He wants to be greeted with COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is special agent Dale Cooper.

DR. JACOBY pulls out one of his ear plugs. Having misheard TRUMAN, he asks...

DR. JACOBY
Uhm, Gary Cooper?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Agent Cooper.

DR. JACOBY
Agent. (points at COOPER) F B I.

COOPER
Right.

DR. JACOBY
(slight laugh) Dr. Lawrence Jacoby agent Cooper. Laura was a patient of mine. Listen, your on your way to the morgue now. Do you mind if I join you?

COOPER
(scans DR. JACOBY from head to toe) Yes I do. Why would you want to?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It's sort of against procedure doctor.

DR. JACOBY
Well, no offense. I ... I thought I could be of some help.

COOPER
You still could be, at another time.

DR. JACOBY
Oh. I ... I understand completely, yeah. Oh. By the way, (slight laugh) Laura's ... uhh ... Laura's parents ... (slight laugh) they didn't know that she was seeing me. (little crazed laugh)

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at each other and then walk off. COOPER turns his head to look at DR. JACOBY and then to SHERIFF TRUMAN as they walk down the hospital hallway.

DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT
I have to apologize again for the fluorescent lights. I ... I think its a bad transformer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What have you got here?

COOPER
Ring finger, under the nail. Let's see what he left us.

COOPER places the piece of paper on a small sheet of glass and flattens out the piece of paper. The small piece of paper has a single letter on it.

COOPER
Its an 'R'. Diane, give this to Albert and his team don't go to Sam. Albert seems to have a little more on the ball. (to SHERIFF TRUMAN) We need a bag and tag this.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smile) Why not.

COOPER
(turns on his mini recorder). Diane, I just opened Laura Palmer's diary. This is the ... uhh ... last entry dated February 23. It reads, "asparagus for dinner again, I hate asparagus. Does this mean I'll never grow up." And then she's written, "nervous about meeting 'J' tonight". That's the letter 'J', Diane. (flips through the pages) Yeah, that is the last entry. Well that's something to get started on.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. That's one out of twenty-six.

COOPER
Yeah, one out of twenty-six. (flips through the front pages of the diary) Diane, I just turned back eighteen days to day one. What we have taped to the page here is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and what looks to be a key to a safety deposit box. Sheriff, after you very carefully remove this key I'm going to run this envelope and my bet is it will test positive for cocaine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(surprised) That's impossible.

COOPER
(looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN) You ever been surprised before?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura Palmer.

COOPER
Let's get started on a court order to open that safety deposit box and maybe we'll both find out a few things about Laura Palmer.

Okay, okay. Well I pretended to be typing but I was typing what Mike and Bobby were saying and ... well they didn't say exactly who it was they were talking about ... but anyway. Here's what they were saying.

Mrs. Horne it might help if you talk to Johnny yourself.

So, you think it might help. Well you can tell Johnny one more time that Laura isn't coming this afternoon to work with him (pause as she looks at Johnny) and tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon. Now what is so difficult to understand about that! (slams a fist to the table)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It must have been a snowshoe rabbit.

COOPER
A snowshoe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

COOPER
A snowshoe, (amazed) snowshoe rabbit.

COOPER scans the room filling with people and spots an Asian woman walking forward.

COOPER
Who's the babe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That is one of the most beautiful women in the state, Mrs. Packard.

COOPER
Packard Saw Mill?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yep.

COOPER
Where's Mr. Packard?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Died in a boating accident last year. Andrew Packard practically built this town. Brought her over from Hong Kong, six years ago, left her everything. Which didn't exactly please his sister. That's her right there.

TRUMAN gestures to the woman, CATHERINE MARTELL, who is sitting on the other side of her husband, PETE MARTELL, that MRS. JOSIE PACKARD is sitting next to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The original deep freeze.

COOPER
Who's the glad handy dandy?

COOPER gestures to a man that has come up to JOSIE and is holding her hand.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Benjamin Horne, local big wig, he owns half the town. He's not after her, he's after her land.

MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, an elderly man, is at the podium banging a gavel. The lights in the room flicker on and off as a woman holding a log is switching them on and off to get people's attention.

COOPER
Who's the lady with the log?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We call her the log lady.

The lights continue to flicker on and off as people slowly start to quiet down.

MAYOR
Ladies and gentlemen. Can I have your attention? (he looks around) Is this thing on? (pats the microphone) Is this thing on!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hang on mayor.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves to the podium and adjusts the microphone as the MAYOR sits down.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you Mayor Milford. Agent Cooper.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gestures to AGENT COOPER to come to the microphone. COOPER clears his throat as he approaches the podium.

COOPER
Thank you sheriff. Ladies and gentlemen, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper. One year ago almost to the day in a town in the Southwest corner of this state the body of a young girl named Teresa Banks was found. She had no family, no one came forward to claim her body. It wasn't even news, until today. There are irrefutable similarities that for obvious reasons I can not discuss that lead us to conclude that Laura Palmer was the second and Ronette Pulaski would have been the third victim of the same killer. Now there is a chance that the person that committed these crimes is someone from this town, possibly even someone you know. You are the leaders of this community. It is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt. I would strongly suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age. Keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them a degree of caution that may protect them in the days and the weeks to come. I will remind you that these crimes occurred at night.

DONNA returns to her room which she shares with her sister HARRIET HAYWARD. HARRIET is sitting up in bed with paper and pencil in hand.

It was kinda like a nightmare. Donna, she was a different person.

What are you saying?

I'm telling you there were things she was involved with, things she let herself get pulled into. Things she thought you hate her for. She said there were things about me ... she said even Donna doesn't know me.

I knew her, I knew her better then she thought I did.

Donna, she said something about a guy getting killed.

DONNA
Who?

JAMES
She didn't say but she said ... Bobby ... told her that he killed this guy.

Oh my god.

This is why I had to see you. It all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died. That someone killed her, I don't know I can't explain it. I didn't know whether to believe any of this last night. I mean half the time she wasn't making any sense. I couldn't calm her down. I could hardly keep her on the bike. We came to the light at Sparkwood and 21 and ... she ... she put her hands around my neck ... and she screamed she loved me. I looked into her eyes, they were clear. Its like she was Laura again. She was so sad. She sounded so desperate. Then she ran off ... (mumbles to a cry)

Why?

Because they found the half where she was killed and they think the killer will have the other half. If you go down there with the necklace and no alibi.

No.

DONNA
We'll hide it.

Alright. We'll bury it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN turns on the police siren and pursues the motorcycle. JAMES pulls his motorcycle to the side of the road and stops.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's not Joey its James Hurley.

TRUMAN grabs his microphone for the cruiser's loudspeaker.

COOPER
I told you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(through the loudspeaker) James, stand away from the bike. Stand away from the girl, put your hands behind your head.

JAMES complies by getting off his bike and, facing them, puts his hands on his heads. DONNA moves towards the police cruiser.

DONNA
He didn't do anything.

COOPER
She's probably right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, slightly annoyed, looks at COOPER and then exits his vehicle.

DONNA
James, he didn't do anything.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yep. Lucy, sets it up for us every night.

LUCY
(over the intercom) Sheriff, is everything okay. There's extra jelly donuts for Agent Cooper and there's some extra decaf, (COOPER grabs a powdered donut) you know Andy's been drinking so much caffinated coffee lately ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you Lucy. You can go back to work now and no listening.

COOPER breaks up his powdered donut, by hand, into little bite size pieces.

COOPER
Sheriff that reminds me. Can you recommend to me a good, inexpensive hotel or motel. Now it doesn't have to be fancy and I mean that.

COOPER eats a piece of donut and immediately wipes his hands with a paper napkin.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I can give you a good rate up at the Great Northern.

COOPER
Because you know I think I'm going to be here for some time and these motels, they'll promise you a good rate and then when you get there its a whole different story. Now all I need is a bed, a bathroom, a telephone and sometimes a television in the unlikely event that one day I'll get a chance to knock off early.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I can get you a good rate up at the Great Northern.

COOPER
Sold. (extends his hand to shake goodbye) Well, tomorrow come early

As COOPER heads out of the room he pulls out his mini tape recorder and turns it on.

COOPER
Diane, its 12:28 am. Looks like I'll be staying locally at a place called the Great Northern Hotel. The sheriff set the arrangements ... (walks off)

SHERIFF TRUMAN remains seated at the conference table laden with donuts and smiles to himself as he hears COOPER walk off.

We get a PANNED view of FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER'S hotel room. Starting at the bedside table where his gun is located we PAN to see two deer hooves holding up a rifle over his bed, a mounted turkey on a table in the corner of the room, a painting with ducks and to a mounted fish. We hear him before we see him, but DALE COOPER is perched six inches above the floor hanging from an apparatus connected to his boots. He is wearing boxer shorts, a t-shirt and a pair of socks. He is talking into the tape recorder which is sitting on the carpet near his head.

COOPER
Diane ... 6:18 am, room 315, Great Northern Hotel up here in Twin Peaks. Slept pretty well. Non-smoking room. There's no tobacco smell. That's a nice consideration for the business traveler. A hint of douglas fir needles in the air. As Sheriff Truman indicated they would, everything this hotel promised, they've delivered: clean, reasonably priced accommodations ... telephone works ... bathroom in really tip-top shape ... no drips, plenty of hot water and good, steady pressure ... could be a side benefit of the waterfall outside my window ... mattress firm, but not too firm ... and no lumps like that time I told you about down in El Paso. What a nightmare that was, but of course you've heard me tell that story once or twice, haven't you Diane. Haven't tried the television yet. Looks like cable, probably no reception problems. But the true test of any hotel, as you now well know Diane, is that morning cup of coffee. Which I'll be getting back to you about within the half hour.

COOPER grabs his tape recorder and shuts it off. He then removes himself from the hanging apparatus and stands up. With the tape recorder in his hand he starts it up again.

TUNE ENDS: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (UPBEAT VARIANT)

COOPER
Diane, it struck me again earlier this morning. There are two things that continue to trouble me, and I'm speaking now not only as an agent of the Bureau, but also as a human being. What really went on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys? And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?

The WAITRESS smiles, places the pot of coffee on the table and grabs a pencil and a pad of paper to take his food order.

COOPER
Now I'd like two eggs, over hard. I know don't tell me, it's hard on the arteries, but old habits die hard, just about as hard as I want those eggs ... bacon, super-crispy, almost burned, cremate it ...

AUDREY
Thank you. (sits) Your here investigating the murder of Laura Palmer.

COOPER
Were you friends with Laura Palmer?

AUDREY
Not exactly. See, Laura tutored my older brother Johnny three times a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and he's in the third grade. He's got emotional problems, it runs in the family. Do you like my ring?

She holds out her hand to show him her ring.

SHERIFF TRUMAN tries to chew.

COOPER
Sheriff, lets get James Hurley up from cell four and talk to him straight. He was in love with Laura Palmer, my bet is she told him whatever dirt she knew about Mike and Bobby and who knows what else. (Truman listens, still chewing) Then lets have a little chat with those two perpetrators, lets also run a top to bottom on Bobby's vehicle , see what that brings us. We'll also check on the autopsy on Laura Palmer and see what that brings in. Oh, we're also gonna want to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer but lets give them a few of days to deal with their grief. Now I got the rest of our day mapped out, lets meet back here in three minutes. Harry, I really have to urinate.

DR. HAYWARD
Harry, as you know, I delivered Laura. I've known her all her life, she was my daughter's best friend. I couldn't bring myself to do the postmortem, so I called Joe Fielding in from Fairvale. He did the work, I assisted. Well, this is what he found. (puts on glasses, consults sheet) Time of death estimated to be between midnight and four AM. What killed her was loss of blood. Numerous shallow wounds, no single one serious enough to have caused death. Bite marks on her shoulders also on her tongue, probably self-inflicted. Lesions on wrists, ankles, and upper arms, where she was bound. We're waiting on the toxological tests for drug use. (he takes off his glasses) Within the last ... twelve hours, she had sexual relations with at least three men.

COOPER
You've examined Ronette Pulaski as well?

DR. HAYWARD
(composing himself) Yes , ... uhh ... there's no question in my mind the same perpetrator attacked both of them in that train car.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doc, when, if ever, will Ronette be able to talk to us?

DR. HAYWARD
She had a severe head injury, it's still early to tell, add to that the psychological impact of the fear, ... probably ... witnessing what was happening to Laura before she ...

She starts to tremble and hears a car horn beep from the front of the house. LEO shouts from the front of the house ...

LEO
Shelly? Norma's here.

SHELLY makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained shirt and stashes it in a nearby drawer. She closes the washer door and starts it just as LEO comes by.

LEO
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's here?

SHELLY
Yeah, I heard you Leo.

SHELLY starts out but LEO catches her by the arm.

JAMES
None. No, sir.

COOPER turns on the VCR and we see the same videotape of LAURA and DONNA HAYWARD at the picnic that we saw earlier. JAMES watches the video.

COOPER

JAMES bows his head in silence. COOPER fast forwards the tape to the freeze frame of the motorcycle reflected in LAURA'S eye.

COOPER
That's your cycle isn't it?

JAMES looks up and sees it.

JAMES
Yes, sir. The three of us went up there two Sundays ago.

COOPER
(gently) James, you were in love with Laura. The two of you were seeing each other secretly. No one else at school, or any of her friends knew about it. She was the homecoming queen, she was dating the captain of the football team. How much longer did you think you could keep this relationship a secret?

JAMES
Well, it was secret because that's the way she wanted it.

COOPER
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

JAMES
I think so.

COOPER
Did you know that she was using cocaine?

JAMES
Yes.

COOPER
Did you ever use cocaine with her?

JAMES
No, I tried to get her to stop and she did for a while.

COOPER
Why did she start using again?

JAMES
Something happened a couple of days ago.

COOPER
What, what happened?

COOPER
Did you and Laura have a fight?

JAMES
Not exactly but she said she couldn't see me anymore.

COOPER
Why?

JAMES
She didn't say.

COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out LAURA'S half-heart necklace.

COOPER walks away from them and towards LUCY'S office to take the call.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure.

LUCY
(to COOPER as she hands him the phone) It has that open air sound, you know, where it sounds like wind blowing, like wind blowing through trees.

COOPER
(into phone) Yes Albert.

BIG ED takes SHERIFF TRUMAN by the arm and lowers his voice.

BIG ED
Harry, I've been thinking about last night at the Roadhouse, and something's not right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(kidding him) Yeah, when I first saw that bandage I thought maybe ol' Nadine got wind of you and Norma.

BIG ED
Harry, if Nadine got wind of me and Norma, I'd be playing harp for the Heavenly All-Stars.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smiles) Ain't that the truth.

BIG ED
I was there seeing Norma but I was also on my stakeout. Now I can remember Mike and Bobby grabbing Donna and I got up to walk over and I got all lightheaded. I was out on my feet before I got there. I don't even remember getting hit.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What do you mean you don't remember?

BIG ED
I'm pretty sure my beer was drugged. Jacques Renault was tending bar.

SHERIFF TRUMAN thinks a moment, then nods.

Inside the store, near the front window is a toy train running and blowing a train's steam whistle. Outside the window, carrying a small tray of sandwiches is NORMA JENNINGS. She is walking to the store which is just down the block from the Double R Diner. As NORMA enters, she almost runs into a woman who's exiting, carrying a big bag of hardware. It's NADINE HURLEY.

NORMA
(pleasantly) Hi, Nadine.

NADINE
What are you doing here, Norma?

NORMA
(pleasantly) I might ask you the same question.

NADINE
(a hint of aggressiveness) And I will tell you. I've gotten all new drapes for my house. Ed bought them for me yesterday at Gentlemen Jim's and we installed them together. They're a beige sheer. I was up all last night, do you know what I was doing?

NORMA
(a little worried) No, I don't.

NADINE
I was inventing a noiseless, completely silent drape runner. And do you know how it works, do you know what makes it work? The thing I thought of at four this morning when I was waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care?

NORMA slightly shakes her head. NADINE takes a package out of the bag.

NADINE
Cotton balls. By god, those things'll be quiet now.

NADINE moves past NORMA out the door. NORMA rolls her eyes at her senselessness.

No, I had a talk with Harry there's no charge.

COOPER
Hi, Mike, Bobby. Now before we get started, have you two fellas got your stories straight?

BOBBY
If we tell the truth, we don't have to get our stories straight.

MIKE
Besides, the sheriff told us we're just in here for fighting and uh ... it was self-defense.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER.

COOPER
Right. Well, I guess you can go then.

BOBBY

COOPER
Mm-hmm.

MIKE and BOBBY stand and make their way to the door. SHERIFF TRUMAN puts his feet up on the table.

MIKE and BOBBY stop at the door and turn to him.

COOPER
Pray for the health and safety of James Hurley, because if anything happens to him, we're coming for you.

MIKE and BOBBY stare at COOPER before leaving.

In a dressing gown, over a negligee, JOSIE PACKARD enters the kitchen, with a happy look on her face.

JOSIE
On top of the morning to you, Pete.

PETE
Uhm, no, Josie, the expression is top of the morning ... and it's just barely morning.

JOSIE
Pete, I want to thank you for yesterday, for standing up to me with Catherine.

PETE
Forget it, Catherine was wrong yesterday, period.

JOSIE
Thank you anyway.

The house intercom buzzes. PETE pushes a button on a nearby unit to answer it.

PETE
Hhellloooo.

COOPER is entering data into his electronic notebook as JOSIE, wearing a red dress, enters the living room with PETE carrying a pot of coffee and two mugs. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN rise up from their seats on the couch.

JOSIE
Hi sheriff.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mrs. Packard, Dale Cooper, FBI. You'll remember him from the town meeting from last night, I'm sure.

COOPER
(shakes her hand) Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Agent Cooper, you remember Pete Martell.

COOPER
Sure, Pete.

PETE
(nods because his hands are full) You bet.

JOSIE
Uhh, can we offer you gentlemen a cup of joe?

COOPER
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic word.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'd love a cup, thanks.

PETE places the cups down on the coffee table and starts to pour.

PETE
Sure, I'll pour that for ya'. Uhh, Mr. Cooper, how do you take it?

COOPER
Black as midnight on a moonless night.

PETE
(looks at COOPER) Pretty black.

After pouring them a cup of coffee, PETE exits the room.

JOSIE
Please, sit down.

COOPER
Mrs. Packard, I'll come straight to the point. Mrs. Packard, I understand that you'd hired Laura Palmer to come visit you twice a week to help you with your English, is that correct?

JOSIE
Yes.

COOPER
When was the last time that you saw her?

JOSIE
Thursday afternoon, about the time the mill blew five.

COOPER
That would be five o'clock?

JOSIE
Yes.

COOPER
And when did she leave?

JOSIE
In an hour, when the lesson was finished. I didn't see her again.

COOPER
How did she seem to you on Thursday afternoon?

JOSIE
Something was bothering her but we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it. Something she said, though, that stuck on my mind. She said, I think now, I understand how you feel about your husband's death.

COOPER
Did she say what that was in reference to?

JOSIE
No, but after what happened to her, I can't help hearing it in my head ... like some haunting melody.

JOSIE glances at SHERIFF TRUMAN. COOPER peers over to SHERIFF TRUMAN to see that he is staring at JOSIE.

COOPER
Mm-hmm.

The phone rings.

JOSIE
Excuse me.

COOPER
Certainly.

JOSIE rises and exits the room to answer the phone. COOPER grins at SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
So Harry, how long have you been seeing her?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(about three different reactions before...) How did you know?

COOPER
Body language.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Geez Louise... uh, not long, six weeks. Andrew died a year and a half ago.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN take a drink of their coffee just as PETE briskly walks back into the room.

PETE
Fellas don't drink that coffee. You'd never guess, there was a fish ... in the percolator. (he takes away the cups of coffee from SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER) Sorry.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN already had a mouthful of the coffee and swallowed it. Both of them sit on the couch with sour faces from the taste of the fishy coffee.

He turns around and walks towards her with a glass of champagne in his hand.

BENJAMIN
In the sweetness of passing time, this hour will soon seem like a day.

CATHERINE
Sing it to somebody else. I'm no peabrain chambermaid looking for a tumble in the broom closet.

BENJAMIN
(insincerely) Sorry, didn't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities?

CATHERINE
Oh no, my mistake. I'd gotten used to our conducting business and pleasure.

BENJAMIN
Sweetheart, it's all the same to me.

CATHERINE
Don't sweetheart me you old dog. I'm no schoolgirl either. What's the next step? Do we escalate?

BENJAMIN
We may not have to do anything. A few more local tragedies and Josie might just run the ol' mill into the ground all by herself.

He refills his glass with champagne.

CATHERINE
The rate we're going its gonna be years before the mill's bankrupt. I don't want to wait any longer. Besides, my knothead husband may peek in the ledger and sniff out the creative arithmetic.

BENJAMIN moves to lean over the bed near her toes.

BENJAMIN
Maybe it's time to ... uh ... start a little fire.

CATHERINE
Are you talking about business or pleasure?

Well, tri temper ira.

Amen.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert, I was hoping we'd have a chance to discuss the events of the past few days. Not necessarily the physical events themselves, but rather the thoughts and feelings surrounding.

BOBBY rolls his eyes and sits quietly. MAJOR BRIGGS is undeterred.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Rebellion in a young man your age is a necessary fact of life, and, candidly, a sign of strength. In other words, Robert, I respect your rebellious nature. However, being your father, I am obligated to contain that fire of contrariness within the bounds established by society as well as those within our family structure.

BOBBY still sits quietly.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert, I note your reluctance to enter in a dialogue with me, your father. There are times when silence is golden. Silence can be taken many ways, as a sign of intelligence the quieter we become, the more we hear...

BOBBY puts a cigarette in his mouth and looks at his father. MAJOR BRIGGS calmly and firmly slaps BOBBY across the face. The cigarette in his mouth flies across the table and spears into the meatloaf on BETTY'S plate. BOBBY'S stunned more than hurt.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Now I am a tolerant man, but my patience has its limits. To have his path made clear is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence. Robert, you and I are going to work to make yours real clear.

Sure thing.

COOPER
Mrs. Jennings, is it true that Laura Palmer used to help you with the Meals on Wheels program, delivering hot dinners to elderly shut-ins?

NORMA
Yeah, Laura helped organize the program.

COOPER starts to eat his pie.

As COOPER eats his pie, the LOG LADY comes up to them as she passes.

LOG LADY
For your information, I heard you speaking about Laura Palmer?

COOPER
Yes?

LOG LADY
One day my log will have something to say about this. My Log saw something that night.

COOPER
Really? What did it see?

She holds the log out.

SHELLY slowly backpedals as LEO advances on her.

DR. JACOBY stands up to retrieve a pair of headphones hanging from a hook on the wall above the stereo and plugs them in. The sound of LAURA'S voice is now coming from the headphones that he is carrying around in his hands. He then walks over to his fifties-style, Hawaiian-themed rec room and grabs a coconut off a short, fake palm tree. He moves over to a large lounge chair and lays back on it.

LAURA
Which as you already know I've mailed it to you in one of the envelopes you gave me. It's Thursday the twenty-third, and I'm so bored ... actually I'm in kind'a of a weird mood. (slight cry in her voice) Doc, James is sweet ... but he's so dumb. I should've met you a long time ago Dr. Jacoby cause right now I can take just so much of sweet. I just know I'm going to get lost in those woods again tonight. I just know it. Remember me telling you about that mystery man. Well ...

DR. JACOBY puts the headphones over both ears and and we no longer can hear her voice. As he listens his face registers a whole gamut of emotions. He then opens the coconut, which is actually a stash box disguised as a coconut, in his hand to reveal the gold half heart with the leather necklace inside that was buried under the rock in the woods by JAMES and DONNA. DR. JACOBY lifts the necklace out of the coconut and starts to cry as he continues to listen to the tape.

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Sometime ideas, like men, jump up and say hello.They introduce themselves, these ideas, with words. Are they words? These ideas speak so strangely. All that we see in this world is based on someone's ideas. Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. I can say it again. Some ideas arrive in the form of a dream.

INT. HORNE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

In the HORNE residence wing of the Great Northern Hotel, the HORNE family sits quietly around the dinner table. BENJAMIN HORNE and SYLVIA HORNE sit at opposite ends of a long dinner table while AUDREY HORNE and JOHNNY HORNE, wearing an Indian headdress, sit opposite each other near the middle of the table. Except for JOHNNY making a few odd sounds, the room is filled with the sounds of tableware clanking as the family eats. Until the door burst open and JERRY HORNE, BENJAMIN'S younger, wiry brother, walks in. JERRY looks back out at the hall.

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:00 - 0:26) (W/O SNAPS)

JERRY
No, no, no, not in my room, in here, IN HERE!

BENJAMIN
Jerry, back from Paris.

JERRY is followed by four BELLHOPS, carrying luggage into the dining room.

JERRY
Ben, what a nightmare.

JERRY shakes his head, turns back to the BELLHOPS and points down.

JERRY
Right THERE, no, no, right there! What is with you guys. (the BELLHOPS place the baggage down) I've got a sandwich in there and I want all those bags opened. We're looking till we find it.

The BELLHOPS hop to it, all the bags are opened and they are scattering clothes around until they find several sandwiches wrapped in white paper. JERRY has moved over to AUDREY.

JERRY
Hey Audrey, uncle Jerry's back. Sylvia.

JERRY moves to SYLVIA as if to kiss her.

SYLVIA
Benjamin! (repulsed and angered by JERRY)

JERRY backpedals away from SYLVIA.

JERRY
Oh-oh, ohh, okay, okay ... gone ... goodbye. (laughs)

JERRY walks over to the sandwiches, picks them all up, places them on the table and unwraps one.

JERRY
Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate, it's a baguette, with brie and butter, I had four of these damn things every day I was there. You gotta try this. (hands a sandwich to BEN) Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead, go ahead.

Very interested, BENJAMIN takes the sandwich and draws his nose over it to smell it deeply.

BENJAMIN
Oh, yeah.

BENJAMIN really likes the smell of the sandwich. Grabbing the long ends of the sandwich, he takes a large bite out of it. With his mouth full he hums in ecstasy. JERRY unwraps himself one and sits nearby at the fireplace. JERRY'S mouth is soon full from a bite of his sandwich and is laughing at BEN'S reaction.

BENJAMIN
(with his mouth full) Uhm, this is incredible, Jerr.

JERRY continues to laugh with his mouth full as BENJAMIN madly takes another big bite out of his own sandwich. SYLVIA is annoyed by their actions. BENJAMIN and JERRY talk to each other with their mouths full.

BENJAMIN
You know what this reminds us of.

JERRY
Mmm.

BENJAMIN
(barely intelligible) Remember when we were kids.

JERRY
Mm.

BENJAMIN
It reminds us of Jeanne and Jenny down by the river. Do you remember? Hmm.

JERRY
My god, your right.

BENJAMIN
Am I right, am I right. Hmm.

JERRY
(laughs) Oh, no wonder.

BENJAMIN
Hmm, hmm. (laughs)

They now both laugh and hum with satisfaction from their sandwiches. BENJAMIN motions to JERRY to follow him.

BENJAMIN
Jerr, outside, outside.

BENJAMIN HORNE wipes his mouth, puts his napkin on the table, rises, smiles and looks around at his family.

BENJAMIN
Always a pleasure.

The rest of the HORNE family continue to eat silently at the table as BEN and JERRY leave the room. They both leave carrying their sandwiches and close the door to the dining room. SYLVIA has both of her hands to her bowed head in frustration.

BENJAMIN
I can fix that. There's a new girl at One-Eyed Jacks, freshly scented ... from the perfume counter. And you, brother Jerr, have a fifty-fifty chance of being first in line.

They both laugh slightly.

JERRY
I like those odds. All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

BENJAMIN
That's right.

JERRY
Let's jump in the boat.

BENJAMIN and JERRY walk away and we FOCUS on the wall they were standing by. The wall has a painting of a lake surrounded by the woods.

BENJAMIN
Hi, sailor.

SWABBIE
Good evening, Mr. Horne.

BENJAMIN walks over to the SWABBIE, extends his arms as does she, rubs his hands over her elbows and smiles at her. JERRY comes up besides them.

JERRY
Now Ben, we're not gonna go into the casino first, are we?

BENJAMIN
Jerr, I didn't come here to lose my shirt, I just came to take it off.

The BARTENDER presses a button, that buzzes, to call BLACKIE. BEN and JERRY enter by stairs to a plush, cozy warmly lit room with a small bar and a pool table.

JERRY
Yodehlaayeehoo.

BEN and JERRY approach the bar and JERRY orders the drinks from a scantily clad female BARTENDER.

JERRY
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two drinks, one double scotch on the rocks and my brother would like a double scotch on the rocks. (winks)

BARTENDER
That's two double scotch on the rocks?

JERRY
Next stop, rocket science.

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (DARK VARIANT)

Several of the establishment's sensational and extraordinary WORKING GIRLS, known collectively as "The 52 Pick-Ups," enter the room one after another. They luxuriously arrange themselves standing into two rows. BEN and JERRY take note of them as they pick up their drinks. Through the middle of the line of girls sweeps BLACKIE "THE BLACK ROSE" O'REILLY, the Madam of the House, an intelligent, strikingly attractive woman in her mid-thirties.

BENJAMIN
(whispered) Wow. Blackie.

BEN walks over to her with his arms extended out to her.

BLACKIE
Benjamin.

BEN kisses her hand and walks around her as he recites ...

BENJAMIN
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. (BLACKIE is amused, JERRY is bored and turns away to smile at the BARTENDER) Rough winds do not shake the darling buds of May, and every fair from fair sometimes declines. By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd. But thy eternal summer shall not fade. Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, Nor shall death brag ...

JERRY walks up to them and interrupts by saying ...

JERRY
Where's the new girl?

A curtain opens, revealing a gorgeous young WOMAN with the face of an angel. BEN and JERRY look at each other, then instantly back to the WOMAN. JERRY takes a coin out of his pocket, flips it, catches it on his wrist and covers it up. BENJAMIN calls it first.

BENJAMIN
Heads.

JERRY and BENJAMIN look down at the coin: heads. BEN smiles, kisses Blackie, pats his brother on the back, and starts towards the WOMAN.

TUNE: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

As BENJAMIN slowly walks toward the WOMAN, she appears nervous and looks away slightly. Near her, BEN extends his palms up for her to guide him into the next room. The WOMAN'S nervousness disappears as she grabs his hands and guides him into the next room. JERRY watches.

JERRY
Wow.

BLACKIE
Come on, we'll take care of you Jerry.

JERRY, slightly depressed, is led to the bar by BLACKIE. JERRY looks at the BARTENDER.

JAMES
Because it's the truth. Because I think it would have turned out this way anyway.

DONNA
You do?

JAMES
Yes, I remember a time in school, in the hall, we were suddenly alone and we looked at each other. I almost told you I loved you then.

DONNA
It's true.

JAMES
It is true, isn't it?

DONNA
Oh James, I guess because of Laura, I couldn't say anything, I couldn't even let myself think it.

JAMES
Me too.

DONNA

The door flies open and FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER enters his room. Still near the door he quickly pulls out his whittled whistle and blows twice on it. The telephone rings, he goes over, sits on the bed and answers it.

COOPER
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

HAWK
(over the phone) Hello, its Hawk.

COOPER
Hey Hawk, how's Ronette Pulaski?

HAWK
(over the phone) Body and spirit are still far apart.

COOPER
What did you find out from her parents?

HAWK
(over the phone) Ronette recently quit her job at the perfume counter of Horne's department store. Everything else is quiet except this afternoon there was a one-armed man snooping around intensive care.

COOPER
(stands up) A one-armed man?

HAWK
(over the phone) Left.

COOPER
Did you question him?

HAWK
(over the phone) Negative. I pursued, but he got away.

COOPER
Maintain an around the clock watch on Ronette and we'll speak in the morning.

There is a knock at the door just before COOPER hangs up the phone. COOPER hangs up, moves to the door and finds a note on the floor near the door. He picks it up, opens the door and looks around but finds nobody. He opens the note and it reads ...

BOBBY

MIKE
Hey.

LEO, now facing BOBBY, shines his flashlight in his face. BOBBY sees someone behind LEO near a tree. This person after being seen hides behind the tree.

BOBBY
Who's that? Is there someone with you.

LEO
Never mind, toss it over here, quarterback.

BOBBY tosses the football to LEO.

BOBBY
It's empty.

LEO
Is that right? Weren't you supposed to leave something in there for me?

BOBBY

LEO
Where's the rest of the money?

MIKE
There's a ... there's a problem.

LEO
(shines the light on MIKE) Problem? (moves the light back to BOBBY)

BOBBY
Laura had the other half in a safety deposit box.

LEO
You think you got problems?

BOBBY
We can get it, Leo, just wait till everything settles down.

LEO
You punks owe me ten grand. (shines his light on his boots) Leo needs a new pair of shoes. (moves the light back to BOBBY)

BOBBY
Okay, we won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash.

LEO
Do I look like a bank!?

BOBBY
I appreciate your position, but this thing with Laura, how could I anticipate that kind of thing.

LEO
(grabs BOBBY'S jacket) Hey man, Laura was a wild girl.

BOBBY
Tell me about it.

LEO
Maybe. Someday.

LEO'S right next to BOBBY, MIKE is standing to the left side of BOBBY. MIKE reaches into his pocket. Without taking his eyes off BOBBY, LEO slowly swivels the shotgun around and trains it on MIKE and then places the light on his face.

LEO
Take your hand out of your pocket, Mike.

MIKE slowly takes his hand out and lifts them up.

BOBBY
What is your problem, Leo?

LEO
(shines the light on his own face) Problem? You want to know about problems?

BOBBY
Okay.

LEO
Your on the road ... driving back and forth, gone for days. You get back and guess what?

BOBBY
What?

LEO
You find out your old lady's been givin' it away.

BOBBY
Yeah?

LEO
Yeah. Steppin' out, in your own damn bedroom. That's a problem.

BOBBY
Yeah, I guess so. I guess it is. (LEO shines the light on his face) Do you know who?

LEO
A man needs a clean house.

BOBBY
Sure yeah ... so do you know who?

LEO
(moves the light to MIKE) I'll take care of it.

BOBBY
Sure you will man and this other thing, hell, we'll take care of that, don't you worry about that. We'll get the cash and everything'll be square.

LEO shines the light on his own face and laughs. He pauses for a while and stares at BOBBY then says ...

LEO
Go out for a pass.

BOBBY
What?

LEO drops the light, pumps the shotgun to load it and points it at BOBBY. MIKE and BOBBY are frightened and slightly raise their hands.

LEO
Go out for a pass.

BOBBY and MIKE back away from him.

MIKE
Geez. Just leave.

On the living room floor, NADINE HURLEY, in workout gear, is vigorously rowing on her rowing machine. Wearing a greasy gas station outfit, 'BIG' ED HURLEY enters the house and stops when he sees NADINE rowing away. BIG ED tries to tiptoe around behind NADINE so she doesn't see him but in doing so he steps on the drape runners and cotton balls laid out on the floor. Cotton balls and the drape runners scatter as BIG ED tries to keep from falling. Some of the grease from his hands falls on the cotton balls. NADINE hears the ruckus and stops rowing to see what has happened.

NADINE
Ed!

BIG ED
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it there.

NADINE
You stepped on my drape runner.

BIG ED
Well, honey, it was right out in the middle of the floor.

NADINE
You think that's an accident. I laid those out there myself, I was up all night working on that invention. I'm going to have the world's first 100% quiet runner!

BIG ED
Well I'm really sorry, Nadine.

NADINE
ED, YOU MAKE ME SICK!

BIG ED nods and moves into the other room. NADINE starts to row again. Pumped up with rage, NADINE grips the metal oars and pulls back on them. We hear NADINE grunting along with the screech of rending steel as she bends the oars back like willow sticks.

SHELLY decides to partially open the door and speak to him, keeping her face out of view.

TUNE: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (0:36 - 0:58)

In the woods, a large blackboard is set up behind the station. A table is set up near the blackboard, covered with the fruits of LUCY'S morning donut run. Four folding chairs are set up near the table. They are all carry mugs of coffee. SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK are at the table of donuts. COOPER is at the blackboard and has just placed the chalk down. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN stands near COOPER with a galvanized metal bucket filled with round rocks. 

ANDY
Where do you want these rocks?

COOPER
Put them right down there by the donuts, Deputy.

ANDY complies. LUCY picks up a coffee pot.

LUCY
Anyone for a warm-up?

EVERYONE
(severally) Ahh yeah, please ... thanks ... you bet ... thanks Lucy.

They all move over for their cups to be refilled. After being served more coffee, COOPER takes a sip and immediately spits it out on the floor. Everyone looks at him.

COOPER
Damn good coffee ... and hot! Would everyone please take a seat.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, HAWK, ANDY and LUCY sit on four folding chairs aligned facing the blackboard. COOPER takes a telescoping pointer out of his coat pocket and expands it to full length.

COOPER
By way of explaining what we're about to do, I'm going to first talk to you a little bit about the country called Tibet.

COOPER flips the two-sided blackboard over, revealing a detailed map of Tibet and surrounding countries tacked to it. The seated group all slowly lean forward.

COOPER
An extremely spiritual country, for centuries the leader of Tibet has been known as the Dalai Lama. In 1950, Communist China invaded Tibet and while leaving the Dalai Lama nominally in charge, they in fact seized control of the entire country. In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to India for his life, and has lived in exile ever since.

COOPER collapses his expanding pointer.

COOPER
Following a dream I had three years ago, I have become deeply moved by the plight of the Tibetan people, and have been filled with a desire to help them. I also awoke from the same dream realizing that I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique, involving mind-body coordination operating hand-in-hand with the deepest level of intuition.

We view a CLOSEUP on LUCY, ANDY, HAWK and TRUMAN. We see that they are all intrigued, but completely mystified.

COOPER
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please assist me, I will now demonstrate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK look at each other and stand up. The blackboard is flipped to the other side. COOPER expands his pointer again.

COOPER
You will recall that on the day of her death, Laura Palmer wrote the following entry in her diary.

COOPER points to where this line is written along the top left side of the blackboard.

COOPER
Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight. Today we're going to concentrate on the 'J's.

COOPER circles the 'J' with chalk. SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK stand near him.

COOPER
Harry, when I give the word, would you please read aloud each of the names I've written on the blackboard.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okey-doke.

COOPER
Deputy Hawk, stand over here (points near the bucket) and hold this bucket of rocks up near me where I can get at them. Would you please put on the kitchen mittens?

HAWK complies.

COOPER
Deputy Andy, move down, stand by the bottle.

ANDY rises, places his coffee on the donut table, and runs towards the distant rock, only too happy to help. HAWK now has the mittens on and is standing with the bucket in his hands.

COOPER
Lucy, take this piece of chalk. (calls out to ANDY) Not too near Andy!

ANDY moves over and LUCY takes the chalk from COOPER.

LUCY
Oh, I'm ... getting excited.

COOPER
And if I should strike the bottle after Sheriff Truman says a particular name, make a check to the right of that name. (turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN) Oh sheriff, I almost forgot, when you say the name, also briefly state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer. Ready?

EVERYONE
(severally) Ready!

COOPER picks out a rock and holds it. He nods to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who looks over to HAWK before proceeding.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

LUCY
You did it, you hit it.

COOPER
Lucy, make a note that the bottle was struck but did not break, very important. Andy, put that bottle back exactly where it was!

LUCY and ANDY follow directions. COOPER nods to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Sorry Andy.

LUCY
Sweetie?

ANDY
(immediately reassuring) It didn't hurt ... it didn't hurt a bit.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling, Andy.

Except for LUCY, they all laugh slightly, including ANDY. As COOPER picks up another rock, SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls him aside to talk privately.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Coop, tell me ... the idea for all this really came from a dream?

COOPER
(smiles) Yes, it did.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks back over to his spot near the blackboard.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(doesn't know who this is) Uh, Jack ... with One Eye.

LUCY
Maybe its the letter 'i' ... but there's no 'i' in Jack.

COOPER
I think perhaps it means he only had one eye, Lucy.

HAWK
Sounds like uh ... Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's wife.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No no no, there's a casino up North called One-Eyed Jack's across the border on the Canadian side.

COOPER
That's it, we're gonna have to go up there and check that place out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okay.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase this because it's a place and not a person. Actually, maybe the person could be in the place. So should I erase it?

COOPER
Yes.

LUCY
Yes, a person could be in the place or yes, I should erase it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

EILEEN
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

DR. HAYWARD
(turns to look at AUDREY) Yeah, saw her at church. I wonder what she's doing down here.

AUDREY places a coin in the jukebox.

TUNE: AUDREY'S DANCE

AUDREY moves over to the counter, removes her large black coat, folds and places the coat on a seat and sits down in an adjacent seat. NORMA comes over to take her order.

NORMA
Hi Audrey.

AUDREY
Hi Norma, could I have a cup of coffee please.

NORMA
Sure.

NORMA walks off to fetch her coffee. AUDREY turns to look at DONNA who is staring at her with a bit of a scowl. DR. HAYWARD is once again eating his pie and speaks to EILEEN.

DR. HAYWARD
Remind me to stop at the hardware store and get those sixty watt bulbs.

NORMA places an empty cup in front of AUDREY and fills it from a pot of coffee. NORMA looks her over, AUDREY appears preoccupied.

AUDREY
Thanks.

NORMA nods and walks off. AUDREY takes a sip of her coffee, places it back down and wipes the lipstick from where she drank it. Once again, she turns to look at DONNA. DONNA is still looking at her but without the scowl.

DONNA
I'm going to go say hi.

DONNA walks over to AUDREY and sits beside her.

DONNA
Hi.

AUDREY
Hi Donna.

DONNA
So my parents said they saw you at church today, I didn't see you.

AUDREY
Yeah, I came by because of Laura.

DONNA
What do you mean? I didn't even think you liked her.

AUDREY
There were things about Laura I didn't like, but she did help take care of my brother Johnny. Guess I sort of loved her for that.

AUDREY runs her finger around the rim of her coffee cup, staring into the cup.

AUDREY
Do you like coffee?

DONNA
Yeah, with cream and sugar.

AUDREY
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

DONNA
(smiles) Audrey.

They both giggle.

AUDREY
But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black.

AUDREY continues to run her finger around the rim of her cup of coffee. DONNA looks at her still grinning about what she said. AUDREY stops and looks at DONNA somberly.

AUDREY
Can I ask you something?

DONNA
Sure.

AUDREY
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

DONNA
What do you mean?

AUDREY
(looks away) Nothing.

DONNA
No, what do you mean.

AUDREY
He used to sing to her. (looks over to the jukebox) God I love this music. (turns to DONNA) Isn't it too dreamy.

AUDREY gets up from her seat, walks over to an open area of the floor near the jukebox and starts to seductively sway to the sound of the music. EILEEN sees her dance and gestures to DR. HAYWARD to take a look. From her seat, DONNA looks oddly at her as she moves to the music.

LUCY looks up from behind the reception window with a book on Tibet in her hands.

ALBERT
(abruptly) Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here.

LUCY
Albert?

ALBERT

SHERIFF TRUMAN presses a button on top of the intercom unit to reply.

Still seated in the conference room, COOPER turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, Albert and his team are the cream of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Working for you, I wouldn't expect anything less.

COOPER places his left hand on SHERIFF TRUMAN'S shoulder.

COOPER
But I gotta warn ya, Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Nobody's perfect.

COOPER
Isn't that the truth?

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks over to his shoulder. COOPER quickly grabs his nose with left hand and makes a 'quack' sound. They both laugh.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk into the reception area and up to ALBERT and his team. COOPER is grinning as ALBERT says ...

ALBERT
What the hell kind of a two-bit operation are they running out of this tree house, Cooper?

COOPER
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

ALBERT
I have seen some slipshod backwater burgs, but this place takes the cake.

SHERIFF TRUMAN has a somewhat angered look on his face. COOPER knows ALBERT well and keeps his cool with a large smile.

ALBERT
What are you waiting for, Christmas? We've got work to do damn it. They're putting this girl in the ground tomorrow and we've wasted half the day traveling out here to the middle of nowhere.

COOPER
Al ... Albert, I suggest you and your team should get started.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.

ALBERT
That'll be fine.

COOPER
(hands ALBERT a file) Results from the local pathologist's report.

ALBERT
(scans it scornfully) Welcome to amateur hour. (to his men) Looks like an all-nighter boys.

They pick up their suitcases.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(moves to ALBERT) Albert, got a minute?

SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls ALBERT aside from the group to talk to him privately.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I hear that you're real good at what you do.

ALBERT
Yeah, that's correct.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well that's good, because normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this kind of crap, he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on queer street.

ALBERT and SHERIFF TRUMAN look eye-to-eye. ALBERT blinks first, puts on his shades, and heads out. His men follow. LUCY enjoyed the confrontation and smiles as they leave. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER, who, with a smile, gives him a thumbs up.

BIG ED is frightened at the tone of her voice. NADINE bursts into the room and runs as if to tackle him. He's a little apprehensive as she approaches but she runs into him and gives him a big hug.

NADINE
Oh Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, I have to thank you.

BIG ED
Why's that?

She looks up at him, her eyes wide and bright.

NADINE
You don't know what you've done for me.

BIG ED

NADINE
Oh Ed, you big lug. When you tracked all that grease into the house today, you spilled some on my cotton balls, but instead of tossin' 'em out I put the greased ones on the runners ... and Ed, just listen to this.

Well you could wash your socks separately.

CATHERINE walks into the bathroom holding a small jar. PETE quietly rises, silently picks up a small vase from the dresser, dumps the contents into his hand and takes out a small key with a tag.

Nice fella. Asked a few questions.

SONG: PENNSYLVANIA 6-5000

He walks into the center of the room and then turns his head to LAURA'S picture on a nearby table. LELAND moves to photograph and picks it up. Slowly, at first, he starts to spin around in place holding the photo at arms length. Faster and faster he spins and starts to moan and then wail. Startled by the sound and the music, SARAH PALMER enters the room to see LELAND dancing and wailing.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see. One chants out between two worlds ... fire ... walk with me. ... We lived among the people. I think you say, convenience store. We lived above it. I mean it like it is, like it sounds. I too have been touched by the devilish one. Tattoo on the left shoulder ... oh, but when I saw the face of god, I was changed. I took the entire arm off. My name is Mike. His name is Bob.

We see a large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped room with a table and three easy chairs. DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. Next to it is a coffee table with a model of Saturn. A LITTLE MAN, three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his back to COOPER, shaking violently. Two of the easy chairs are close together. Beside them are two tall Saturn lamps. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER sits across from COOPER in one of those chairs.

COPPER stares at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and she stares back at him. He turns to look at the LITTLE MAN. The LITTLE MAN stops shaking, turns to COOPER and claps his hands once.

LITTLE MAN
Let's rock!

The LITTLE MAN moves over and sits in a chair beside the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly together, a ringing sound is produced.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

COOPER looks at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, who is still staring at him and smiles enigmatically. She slowly puts a finger to the side of her nose and then slowly lowers her hand, almost pointing at him as it drops. As the LITTLE MAN rubs his hands, a shadow of a bird passes in the background behind the red drapes.

Both the LITTLE MAN'S and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S speech is oddly stilted but COOPER'S speech is normal. We see subtitles under them, with the correct words. The LITTLE MAN stops rubbing his hands, opens his eyes, turns to COOPER and says ...

LITTLE MAN
I've got good news! That gum you like is going to ... come back in style.

COOPER sits quietly listening to him and turns to the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN turns to look at the WOMAN and then back to COOPER.

LITTLE MAN
She's my cousin, ... but doesn't she look ... almost exactly like Laura Palmer?

COOPER
But it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura Palmer?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I feel like I know her, (distressed) but sometimes my arms bend back.

LITTLE MAN
She's filled with secrets. Where we're from, the birds sing a pretty song ... and there's always music in the air.

Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The LITTLE MAN hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN rises, goes over, and gently kisses COOPER on the mouth. She then softly whispers something in his ear.

AUDREY
Do you really think so?

COOPER
Yes I do. Please have a seat. And would you write your name down for me. Here. (he gives her a pen and a napkin)

AUDREY
Okay.

AUDREY writes her name down on a napkin and COOPER watches. From his pocket, he removes the note that was slipped under his door and compares the handwriting to AUDREY'S signature as she writes it.

COOPER
Audrey, there's something you'd like to tell me.

AUDREY
There is?

COOPER
You slipped this note underneath my door the night before last.

TRUDY
Griddle cakes, slice of ham.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who killed Laura Palmer?

COOPER
(sips his coffee) Ahhh. Harry, let me tell you about the dream I had last night.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Tibet?

COOPER
No. You were there, Lucy so were you. Harry my dream is a code waiting to be broken. Break the code solve the crime.

LUCY
(taking notes; repeats) Break the code ... solve the ... crime.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at what LUCY is writing as she repeats the line. She is a little embarrassed by it after she notices that she was being watched.

COOPER
In my dream, Sarah Palmer has a vision of her daughter's killer. Deputy Hawk sketched his picture. I got a phone call from a one-armed man, named Mike. The killer's name was Bob.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mike and Bobby?

COOPER
No, its different Mike and a different Bob. They lived above a convenience store. They had a tattoo, fire walk with me. Mike couldn't stand the killing any more so he cut off his arm. Bob vowed to kill again so Mike shot him. Do you know where dreams come from?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Not specifically. (he and LUCY nod no)

COOPER
Acetylcholine Neurons fire high voltage impulses into the forebrain. These impulses become pictures, the pictures become dreams but ... no one knows why we choose these particular pictures.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well, what was the end of this dream?

COOPER
Suddenly it was twenty five years later. I was old sitting in a red room.

INT. WAITING ROOM

We review the last portion from COOPER'S dream as we hear his voice describing the dream. A large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped room with a table and three easy chairs. DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER, slowly moves over to COOPER.

COOPER
There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman. The little man told me that my favorite gum was coming back into style and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer, which she did.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What cousin?

In the replay of dream, the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gently kisses COOPER on the mouth and then whispers something in his ear.

COOPER
The beautiful woman. She's filled with secrets, sometimes her arms bend back, where she's from the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air. The midget did a dance, Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.

COOPER
Harry, our job is simple. Break the code, solve the crime.

SHERIFF TRUMAN'S police radio buzzes for an incoming call, he answers it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. (reply over the radio) You hang on I'll be right there. That was Andy, there's a fight over at the morgue.

COOPER

COOPER'S breakfast had just arrived and he scans it over knowing he won't be able to enjoy it because he has to leave.




CUT TO:

INT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

We view a CLOSEUP of LAURA PALMER'S face. We ZOOM OUT to view that LAURA PALMER'S body is on an examining table covered with a sheet. On the other side of the table, in the background, BENJAMIN HORNE is looking down at her. We are in an examination room of the hospital in the morgue. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and DR. WILL HAYWARD stand near the table arguing. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is standing behind DR. HAYWARD and watches the two argue.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.

ALBERT
Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.

BENJAMIN
Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)

ALBERT
Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.

ALBERT
The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.

COOPER
Gentlemen!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's going on!

ALBERT
Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.

ALBERT
Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's the holdup?

ALBERT
Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I've had just about enough of your insults.

ALBERT
Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.

ALBERT
Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.

COOPER
Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.

ALBERT
Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!

COOPER
That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.

ALBERT
He hit me.

COOPER
Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

ALBERT walks out of the room.

DR. HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

MOONIE
I'm sure Hank appreciates your unwavering devotion. Your husband has been a model prisoner. (puts the picture away in a folder) An inspiration to god and inmate alike. He greets the day with a smile and confound adversity with a kind word. Hank's parole hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, baring unforeseen circumstance. With your full support, before the board, he could be released shortly thereafter. Any questions?

NORMA

Will you help find the job that Hank needs to effect a successful parole.

NORMA
Yes.

Well Leo is one of those guys you keep on a list and keep your eye on. So far we haven't caught him with the paws in the cookie jar.

They both walk up to LEO who is chopping wood outside his house.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Morning Leo.

LEO
Who the hell is he? (gestures to COOPER)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI. We'd like to ask you a couple of questions?

LEO
So ask.

COOPER
Leo, is that short for Leonard.

LEO
That's a question?

COOPER
Did you know Laura Palmer?

LEO
No. (splits a log)

COOPER
How well did you know her?

Nothing, you can look it up.

In the dining room, BOBBY BRIGGS, wearing a suit, is facing a christian cross hanging on the wall. He is smoking a cigarette. At first he looks at the cross and then stretches his arms out, imitating. Then he slowly moves toward it, with both hands, as if to grab it. MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, in his usual Air Force uniform, enters the room from the side.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert. (surprised, BOBBY turns to him) This may be a good time for a brief discussion.

BOBBY
You want to talk about cigarettes, today!

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, but put it out. Its a filthy habit especially for a varsity athlete.

BOBBY takes one last drag, turns to the table and extinguishes his cigarette in a ash tray. He then takes a seat at the table. His father follows suit next to him.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I have attended my share of funerals, too many. Anytime a man dies in war, he dies too soon. (places his hand on BOBBY'S shoulder, it annoys him) Laura died too soon as well.

BOBBY
Yeah, she did.

MAJOR BRIGGS
But we have a responsibility to the dead, Robert. Responsibility is the linch pin of our society. Each man responsible for his own actions. Each action contributing to the greater good.

BOBBY starts to play with his cigarette lighter; opening it, lighting it and closing it.

BOBBY
What's the good of putting someone in the ground.

BOBBY lights the cigarette lighter and places it on the table. As his father speaks, BOBBY waves his hand over the flame.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Its man's way of achieving closure. The ceremony begins understanding and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind. Robert, in your life you must learn, you will learn, to carry on without them.

BOBBY
Great.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I realize you experience an ongoing disinclination to enter a meaningful exchange. This leads to stalemate ... the desire on my part to pour certain wisdom upon you. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes its the best course available. Son don't be afraid. We'll all be there together.

BOBBY closes his lighter.

BOBBY
Afraid of what?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Well the funeral.

BOBBY
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral. Afraid? I can hardly wait. AFRAID! I'M GOING TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN!

BOBBY is upset but composes himself. MAJOR BRIGGS sits with a disenchanted look. BETTY BRIGGS, putting on handgloves, enters the room smiling completely unaware of what has just conspired.

BETTY
Everybody ready?

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk up a hallway in the building. DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK' HILL meets them as he enters the hall from a side door.

COOPER
Deputy Hawk.

HAWK
Agent Cooper, there's no sign of the man with one arm.

COOPER
Keep trying he's out there somewhere.

HAWK splits. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER walk up to the door to the conference room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

COOPER
Tracker?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The best.

COOPER
Oh. (look of admiration)

Together they enter the conference room where ALBERT is seated at the table.

COOPER
Okay Albert, what ya' got?

ALBERT
Enough forensic spade work to save your butt and get mine out of this god forsaking burg.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN sit together opposite ALBERT. Next to ALBERT is a television monitor and video cassette player along with a folder filled with the materials he has collected in his investigation of LAURA'S body.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What ya' got?

ALBERT gives him a smirk.

ALBERT
Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Toxicology results also positive. News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.

COOPER
Sometimes my arms bend back.

ALBERT
Here we got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good lord.

ALBERT plays a video tape. The tape shows a closeup of scratches on LAURA'S body that he points out.

ALBERT
Distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be ... claw marks. Bites of some kind.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
An animal?

ALBERT
(smiles and points at TRUMAN; smartass) Look its trying to think.

COOPER doesn't react to his smartass remark. ALBERT shuts the monitor off.

ALBERT
Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids. (throws a small packet with the item for them to inspect) I'm taking it back to the lab for reconstruction as the local facilities give new meaning to the word primitive. I note with some interest what appears to be the letter 'J'.

COOPER
Good work Albert.

ALBERT
Couple more days with the body who know's what else I might have found.

DEPUTY ANDY peers through the open door of the conference room.

ANDY
Sheriff, its time.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Excuse us. We ... have got a funeral to get to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room. COOPER also gets up to leave.

ALBERT
Cooper, may I have a word with you alone?

COOPER stops short of the door and closes it for privacy.

ALBERT
There's one more item. Its a report concerning the physical assault on my person which you witnessed this morning. I think you find that's its quite accurate. Requires your signature.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.

COOPER
Albert, I'm not going to sign this.

ALBERT
What?

COOPER
Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.

ALBERT
Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.

COOPER
With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.

COOPER
Diane, its 12:27 pm. I'd like you to look into my pension plan options regarding outside real estate investment. I may look into purchasing a piece of property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.

Oh Ed, last night was wonderful. Oh my darling Ed, you came back to me. Now I feel like we're really together again. At high school I used to watch Norma and you at the football games. She was so pretty and you made such a handsome couple. But I knew, even though I was just ... a little nobody, just a little brown mouse. I always knew inside ... once you got to know me ... that we be together forever.

NADINE hugs him and lays her head on his chest. BIG ED has a distant look on his face. A motorcycle can be heard outside the house.

NADINE
That's not your bike is it Ed?

BIG ED
It's James.

NADINE

JAMES enters the house and sees NADINE in BIG ED'S arms.

BIG ED

EXT. GHOSTWOOD MEMORIAL PARK - DAY

We start with a CLOSEUP of REVEREND CLARENCE'S face as he gives the sermon. Our view then switches to a bird's eye view of the crowd around casket. As REVEREND CLARENCE BROCKLEHURST gives his sermon, we view several different faces in the crowd starting with COOPER, DONNA HAYWARD, BOBBY and BIG ED. Next as the sermon continues we view COOPER follow BOBBY'S eyes to JAMES who has just arrived. BOBBY scornfully looks at JAMES. DONNA and JAMES look at each other. PETE has tears in his eyes as he looks at the casket. AUDREY and COOPER look at each other and smile.

REVEREND CLARENCE
I am the resurrection and the life. He that believe'th in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And who shall ever live'th and believe'th in me shall never die. For none of us live'th to himself and no man die'th to himself. For if we live, we live unto the lord and if we die, we die to the lord. Whether we live therefore or we die, we are the lords. Blessed be the dead who die of the lord. Even so say'th the spirit. For they rest from their labors. The lord be with thee. Let us pray. Oh god entrust this child, Laura, to thy never failing care and love and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom. Through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our lord who live'th and reign'th with thee and the holy spirit. One god now and forever, amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin. For the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked to much. I'll not make that mistake today. Just let it be said that I loved her and I will miss her the rest of my days.

JOHNNY
Aaamen! Amen!

REVEREND CLARENCE
Thank you Johnny.

BOBBY
AAAAAMENN!

From the back of the crowd BOBBY moves himself forward pushing people out of the way.

BOBBY
What ya' looking at? What are ya' waiting for? You make me sick. You damn hypocrites make me SICK! Everybody knew she was in trouble but we didn't do anything. All you good people, you wanna know who killed Laura. YOU DID! We all did and pretty words aren't going to bring her back man so save your prayers. She would've laughed at them anyway.

From the other side of the crowd, behind the crowd, JAMES rushes over to confront BOBBY. BOBBY sees him and reciprocates. MIKE NELSON also runs over. We view the action as COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK, MAJOR BRIGGS and BIG ED rush to catch, and stop them from fighting.

BOBBY
You are dead man, your dead!

Our view of the scene is now SLOWED down as COOPER and BIG ED hold back JAMES, SHERIFF TRUMAN and MAJOR BRIGGS hold BOBBY and HAWK holds MIKE back.

BOBBY
Yyyoouurrr ddeeaadd!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's enough Bobby, that's enough.

BOBBY
Yyyoouu aarree DDEEAADD!

The action returns to NORMAL. JAMES stops his attempt as he is held back by COOPER and BIG ED but he stares down BOBBY. BOBBY continues to wrestle with his father and SHERIFF TRUMAN as he yells at JAMES.

BOBBY
Get off of me. You are a dead man, dead! You are dead man, dead! Get off of me.

Near the casket, LELAND is crying heavily for his daughter. Suddenly he spreads his arms out and throws himself onto the casket. SARAH PALMER screams. The casket, being held above the bottom of the grave by straps connected to a motor, starts to move down. The mechanical system is overwhelmed by the extra weight and generates a screeching metal sound as it fails.

LELAND
Oh my baby, Laura.

LELAND hugs the casket as it slowly moves down into the grave but the mechanical system kicks in again. It starts to raise the casket out of the grave but fails again and the casket goes down again. Again and again the mechanical system tries to lift the casket and fails producing the sound of screeching metal each time. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER try to grab LELAND.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland.

REVEREND CLARENCE
The whole thing has gone haywire.

SARAH
(to LELAND) Don't ruin this too.

LELAND

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT

At the counter, SHELLY JOHNSON retells the scene at the funeral to two customers having a meal. Using a metal napkin dispenser and her hand, making an inverted peace sign, she visually shows what happened. 

SHELLY
This is the father (her hand) and this is the daughter in the coffin (napkin dispenser).

With her hand, SHELLY uses it to look like a small man on the edge of the counter. With her free hand she is holding the napkin dispenser off the counter but to the edge. Next, she shows how LELAND jumped on the casket by dropping her 'small man' onto the dispenser.

SHELLY
Boom.

She finishes by raising and lowering the napkin dispenser with her 'small man' on top. SHELLY also provides the sound effects of crying and of the broken machinery. The two customers laugh at it all.

We PAN to a booth in the background were BIG ED, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK are seated. The table has three empty pie plates and cups of coffee.

BIG ED
I'm telling you Harry. He's just not going to figure this out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ed, that's a bet I'll take for the check. (COOPER enters) He's right on time.

BIG ED
Harry, careful who you trust. He's just not one of us.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper. Take a seat.

COOPER
Harry, I got your note. Hawk, Big Ed. (nods to them)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How would you like some fresh huckleberry pie?

BIG ED waves to NORMA.

COOPER
I would love a slice of pie. (NORMA arrives to take a food order) Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated, vanilla ice cream on the side, coffee.

NORMA
Coming right up.

Before she leaves, she looks at BIG ED and smiles. BIG ED has been starring at her and returns the smile. COOPER immediately makes the connection.

COOPER
Big Ed, how long have you been in love with Norma?

Completely surprised, BIG ED doesn't say a word. He just looks over to HAWK and SHERIFF TRUMAN, who is smiling.

TUNE ENDS: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (VARIANT)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.

BIG ED grabs the check on the table.

COOPER
Okay, what you fellas call me in to talk about besides the highlights of the dinner menu?

BIG ED
Better tell him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody running drugs into Twin Peaks from across the border. We've been working this for six months trying to set up a bust: top to bottom, nobody walks.

COOPER
Who's targeted?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jacques Renault, bartender at the Roadhouse. We figure him for the middle man. Now Ed's been doing some undercover. In fact, the night you got into town he was staking Renault out. We think Renault slipped him a mickey.

BIG ED
Felt like somebody hit me with a log splitter.

COOPER
Ed, I didn't know you were a deputy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He's not.

COOPER looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN, a little surprised, then returns to BIG ED.

COOPER
Well that's a little outside your jurisdiction, don't you think?

BIG ED
Somebody selling drugs to high school kids and I figure that's everybody's jurisdiction.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I call Ed in when I need him. He's not the only one I call.

NORMA arrives with COOPER'S pie and a pot of coffee. COOPER digs right into his pie as she fills his cup with coffee.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks Norma.

NORMA
Enjoy.

COOPER
(relishing) Mmm, this must be where pies go when they die. Mmm.

TUNE: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

COOPER
Okay Harry, would you please tell me why you really called me in here.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, your gonna have to go along with me on this. Even if it sounds a little weird.

COOPER
I'm with you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Twin Peaks is different, a long way from the world. You've noticed that.

COOPER
Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's exactly the way we like it but there's a ... back end to that that's kind of different too. Maybe that's the price we pay for all the good things.

COOPER
What would that be?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There's a sort of evil out there. Something very, very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want. A darkness, a presence. It takes many forms but ... its been out there for as long as anyone can remember and we've always been here to fight it.

COOPER
We?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Men before us, men before them and after we're gone.

COOPER
A secret society. (wide eyed, great interest)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why don't we take Agent Cooper for a little ride.

BIG ED, HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER enter the Bookhouse, a darkly lit log building with a bar on one side of the room. Shelves, floor to ceiling, loaded with books divide the space, opposite the bar, into compartments.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is where we get together. Going on twenty years now.

COOPER
We meaning?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys. The coffee's free.

COOPER
I like the sound of that.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leads COOPER to a compartment where JAMES HURLEY and JOEY PAULSON guard a young man tied up in a chair with a gag over his mouth. The young man is BERNARD RENAULT a younger brother of JACQUES.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, you know James.

JAMES
Agent Cooper.

COOPER
James.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is Joey Paulson.

COOPER
Joey.

JOEY nods to COOPER.

COOPER
Who is this?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Bernard Renault, Jacques brother, janitor at the Roadhouse. Bernard came across the border this morning with an ounce of cocaine in his kitbag. I thought we'd ask him a few questions.

JOEY removes the gag over BERNARD'S mouth.

COOPER
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura Palmer?

BERNARD speaks with a heavy French-Canadian accent.

BERNARD
I don't sell drugs.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How much does Jacques pay you to be the mule?

BERNARD
Jacques don't pay me nothing. I'm no mule.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
So that ounce you had that was for personal use?

BERNARD
That's right.

COOPER
I guess you don't get a whole lot of sleep at night then, huh Bernie.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your brother didn't come into work the last few days. Where's he been?

BERNARD
I don't know. He got personal business.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who else is he dealing with?

BERNARD
Why don't you ask him yourself? He be back tonight, in a minute.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He's coming to work at the Roadhouse?

BERNARD
He the bartender isn't he.

COOPER
(leans toward BERNARD) Bernard, we got you tied up in a chair. Your mixed up with your brother in a wide variety of felonies. What I want to know is why in the world would you tell us where and when to find him?

Andrew built this years ago. (using a key she unlocks it) I don't think Catherine knows that I know its here. (turns to look at TRUMAN, opens the door of the safe) Why do you think we have two sets of books?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The usual reasons would have something to do with stealing maybe worse.

JOSIE looks into the safe and sees only one book, not the two she expects to find. She pulls out the one book and hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who looks it over.

JOSIE
There were two. I saw them. You believe me don't you.

Of course I do. There's nothing unusual in this one.

PETE MARTELL walks in and sees her at her desk. PETE tries to back out unnoticed but she sees him. He knows he's been caught but tries to cover it up.

PETE

The next time you and the merry widow want to take a peek in my safe don't go through so much trouble. Be a man about it Pete. Ask me to my face.

SARAH
Yeah, yeah. His hair was long, filthy gray on gray, long hair.

MADELEINE FERGUSON walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN with a silver coffee set and offers him some coffee. He grabs a cup of the tray and looks at her. MADELEINE, with her long black hair and thick rim glasses, smiles.

No, never. His face, my god, his face. (becomes upset)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Morning Lucy. What's going on?

LUCY
Uhh thanks to Jade, Jared decided not to kill himself and he's changed his will, leaving the Towers to Jade instead of Emerald but Emerald found out about it and now she's trying to (TRUMAN and ANDY look at each other in befuddlement) seduce Chet to give her the new will so she can destroy it. Montana's planning to kill Jared at midnight so the Towers will belong to Emerald and Montana but I think she's going to double cross him and he doesn't know it yet. Poor Chet.

He wears a pair of glasses with one red lens and one blue lens. AGENT COOPER sits at the other end of the table sternly watching DR. JACOBY perform a magic trick. The magic trick has two white balls between the fingers on one hand. He taps that hand against his head and one ball disappears. He opens his mouth to reveal the ball. DR. JACOBY performs the trick twice before COOPER asks ...

COOPER
Was Laura Palmer seeing you because she was addicted to cocaine?

DR. JACOBY
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help ya' but uh ... got a little problem here, uh. Look may-maybe there's some sort of hula we can do around my doctor / patient confidentiality, huh.

COOPER
It is safe to say she came to you because she was having problems?

DR. JACOBY
Oh my yes.

COOPER
Were her problems of a sexual nature?

DR. JACOBY
Agent Cooper, the problems of our entire society are of a sexual nature.

DR. JACOBY stands up, walks over to the blackboard with the map of Tibet and looks it over.

DR. JACOBY
Tibet. (smiles) You know, my abiding interests lie to the East as well but only as far as Ha-vai-i (Hawaii). The ancient Hawaiians often turn to the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant to ease the pain of profound confusion. Which, more often then not, was sexual.

COOPER
Ginger is nonaddictive, cocaine is.

DR. JACOBY
Look the-the fact that-that Laura Palmer sought medication, no matter how dubious, was actually a positive sign.

COOPER
Dr. Jacoby, I understand you cared deeply for Laura Palmer. Why is it that you won't help us?

DR. JACOBY moves toward COOPER.

DR. JACOBY
My ... own ... personal investigation, I suspect, will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

SHERIFF TRUMAN enters the room. Now close to COOPER, DR. JACOBY bends slightly to him and says ...

DR. JACOBY
Laura ... had ... secrets ... and around those secrets she built the fortress ... that, well that in my six months with her, I was not able to penetrate and for which I consider myself ... an abject failure.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss Bobby Briggs or James Hurley with you?

DR. JACOBY
Now they were boys, Laura was a woman.

COOPER
She had sex with three men the night she was murdered. Were you one of them?

DR. JACOBY looks as if he is going to proudly say yes but sighs and says ...

DR. JACOBY
No.

COOPER
Who killed her Dr. Jacoby?

DR. JACOBY
The night after Laura died, I followed a man that uh ... Laura had spoken to me about. He was driving a red corvette. I followed him to the old sawmill road and then I lost him. And that gentlemen is all I can tell you.

The intercom unit buzzes. LUCY'S voice can be heard over the speaker.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, there's a Gordon Cole on the phone. He say's your expecting his call. Should I put him through?

COOPER
Yes Lucy, put him through. Thank you doctor that will be all.

DR. JACOBY heads out but is stopped at the door by a question.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You'll be in town doctor?

DR. JACOBY
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble Beach ... but that's not till the end of the month. Hang loose howies.

DR. JACOBY gives a hang loose hand sign and leaves the room.

COOPER
Does Leo Johnson drive a red corvette?

COOPER moves to a small table along the wall, picks up the intercom unit and places it on the table.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes.

COOPER
How we doing on Jacques Renault?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There's an APB on him. His brother made bail this morning. I got an all points on him too.

COOPER composes himself before turning the intercom unit on. The man speaking over the intercom is GORDON COLE, COOPER'S superior.

COOPER
Harry this is my supervisor. (presses the button on intercom unit) Good morning Gordon. How we doin'?

GORDON
(over the speaker) Cooper, where do we start? The Palmer girl or Albert's new best friend, Harry Truman.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, a little worried, walks over to the window.

COOPER
Laura Palmer.

GORDON
Albert has been very busy. The twine he found in her upper arm is a common household variety, Finley's Fine Twine.

COOPER
And the twine on her wrists?

GORDON
Definitely not a match. No ID yet and those marks on her shoulders, bird bites.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Bird bites?

GORDON
He'll also be faxing a reconstruction of the plastic fragment from her stomach.

COOPER
Great, tell Albert we're anxiously waiting his results.

GORDON
Now for the bad news Coop. I got an OJ and a AFO here from Albert concerning his mano y mano with the local Sheriff Truman. Albert wants this guy's badge Coop.

A little agitated, COOPER stands up and becomes rather animated as he talks.

COOPER
Gordon, here's how it is. You know Albert. In my opinion Sheriff Truman displayed the patience of a saint 'not' clocking him a day earlier then he did.

GORDON
He wants it filed with the US Attorney.

COOPER
File it under 'F' for forget it.

GORDON
Cooper?

COOPER
And you tell Albert that if he wants to pursue this I'll fight him all the way up the chain to Washington.

DEPUTY ANDY walks into the room.

GORDON
Cooper? Coop, don't get excited and hang up on me now.

COOPER
Talk to you later Gordon.

COOPER presses the button on intercom unit to hang up.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks. I didn't ... get a whole lot of sleep last night.

COOPER
Harry, the last thing I want you to worry about, while I'm here, is some city slicker I brought into your town relieving himself upstream.

ANDY hands COOPER the drawing he produces using SARAH'S description from her vision.

COOPER
This is the man I saw in my dream.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You saw this man?

COOPER
I had an intuition that my dream and Sarah Palmer's vision were connected. I didn't go with you this morning because I didn't want to influence her. I'm a strong sender. (to ANDY) The eyes were a bit closer together.

The intercom buzzes and LUCY can be heard from the speaker.

LUCY
Deputy Hawk calling in for Agent Cooper.

COOPER picks up a nearby phone.

COOPER
Hawk. (reply over the phone) Right. Stay there. Follow him if he moves.

COOPER hangs up the phone and turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN and ANDY.

There's a drop panel on the top drawer. Not even Pete the poodle knows about that one. I'm famished.

CATHERINE and BENJAMIN take a sip of wine. We can hear the television program.

MONTANA
(from the television) Let's get one thing straight I didn't spend the evening busting up the Amazons by dodging blow darts ...

CATHERINE
I suppose room service is too much to expect of this rusticated mildew farm.

You would prefer the lumber baron's suite at the Great Northern.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, with his gun drawn, walks up towards the motel room door where the ONE-ARMED MAN, PHILLIP MICHAEL GERARD, is staying. As he walks, he passes a timber truck rig full of large tree logs. AGENT COOPER and DEPUTY ANDY are right behind him. ANDY has his hand on his gun, still in its holster. COOPER draws his gun and stands behind ANDY. SHERIFF TRUMAN knocks on the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mr. Gerard, its the police, open up.

ANDY fumbles with his gun to pull it out of the holster and drops it. The revolver discharges when it hits the ground. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER jump. COOPER is furious for the loss of control in a serious situation. He spins around and shouts.

COOPER
Geez!

SHERIFF TRUMAN ducks down, picks up the gun and hands it to ANDY.

Oh, Bob Lydecker is just about my best friend in the world.

COOPER
Why have you been at the hospital the past two days?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Bob's in a coma.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There was a Lydecker assaulted three days ago outside a bar. In Lowtown.

ONE-ARMED MAN
That's Bob. (nods)

COOPER
Is your friend Bob a doctor?

ONE-ARMED MAN
He's just about the best dern veterinarian in these parts?

HAWK is on the phone near a bedside stand.

HAWK
Thanks. (hangs up) He's clean, no record, no warrants.

HAWK tosses MR. GERARD'S wallet to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who hands it to COOPER. COOPER scans it over before handing it to MR. GERARD. SHERIFF TRUMAN gives HAWK an order.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Take a look at his car.

We watch DEPUTY ANDY nervously move and peer at a closed suitcase standing atop a table.

COOPER
Your middle name is Michael?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Named after my uncle.

COOPER
How'd you lose the arm?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Car accident. I was on the road from Memphis to ... uh ... someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals. (waxing enthusiasm) Pretty good job.

A commotion of rumbling comes from the side of the room. We view ANDY slightly embarrassed as he fumbled in opening the suitcase causing its contents of shoes to spill out onto the table and the floor.

ONE-ARMED MAN
That's what I'm selling these days. Everybody needs shoes.

ANDY
There all for the right foot.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Its my sample case. (picks up a shoe) Yeah, two day delivery, guaranteed. Oh and we could certainly take care of all your departmental needs.

COOPER
The arm you lost, did it have a tattoo?

ONE-ARMED MAN
What's this all about? I'm a shoe salesman.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

DONNA
Isn't that that western with Marlon Brando?

AUDREY
Its a place across the border. They have girls working there.

DONNA
Are you saying you think Laura was one of them?

AUDREY
I don't know but if its true wouldn't you want to know about it.

DONNA
Well, it sure'd explain a few things.

You know I think about it ... I think about Laura being in a place like that and I get all shivery ... but its like a hot cold. Like when ... you hold an ice cube on your bare skin for a long time.

DONNA
Audrey, I'll help you but whatever we find out we have to promise to keep it between ourselves. Our secret.

PAROLE JUDGE #1
You were not incarcerated for an act of fate Mr. Jennings.

HANK
I accept that ... but it was fate. Maybe, in an odd way, even luck that sent me to prison. Just as much as the car accident.

Yes, but only one has a best friend with one arm. Harry ...

A llama disrupts AGENT COOPER as he speaks with SHERIFF TRUMAN by walking between them and even nearly touching his face with its face. The llama snorts as it walks by.

COOPER

ANDY walks up to COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN.

BOBBY
Leo's not going to be a problem for us anymore. Just stay clear of him, keep quiet.

She moves back to the cabinet, reaches into the stash compartment and pulls out a gun.

SHELLY

BOBBY
Do you know how to use it?

SHELLY opens the top of her waitress uniform, revealing some lingerie, and holds the gun to her chest.

HAWK notices COOPER'S gun before he puts it back in its holster.

HAWK

COOPER
Actually its standard issue. I made a few modifications. (privately to TRUMAN) How long has Lucy been upset with Andy?

SHERIFF TRUMAN

HAWK
Amen to that.

HAWK puts on his ear protection cover.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Amen. Hawk, Andy.

The rest also put on their ear protection cover.

HAWK confidently and quickly fires his gun at the practice target down the gunnery range. ANDY has a hard time just holding on to the gun as he quickly fires. When their finished, the target sheets are retrieved from the distant shooting area by a motorized line. They all remove their ear protectors and rest them on their shoulders around their neck. HAWK collects the target sheets and hands them to COOPER. COOPER checks over the target sheets to see how they scored.

COOPER
Hawk, six for six. Two kills, high marks. Andy. (ANDY'S target sheet has no holes) Andy what we need is practice and lots of it. One hour, three times a week. Harry you'll supply the ordinance.

HAWK
One woman can make you fly like an eagle another can give you the strength of a lion but only one in the cycle of life can fill your heart with wonder and the wisdom that you have known a singular joy. I wrote that for my girlfriend.

COOPER, impressed, whistles. He returns his attention to the target sheets.

COOPER
Harry, one miss five hits. Three kills, excellent.

SHERIFF TRUMAN silently looks over COOPER target sheet and then hands it to HAWK.

HAWK
Only four hits?

COOPER
Well I put four through the eyes and one through each nostril.

We view the target sheet and see two holes where the eyes and where the nostrils would be in the human form of the target sheet.

HAWK
Nice pattern.

LUCY speaks over the intercom.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm looking at the files from Dr. Lydecker's and, for instance, I have here in the 'A's an Arky who's a part poodle part rottweiler, who lives on Maple and belongs to Mr. Rumple. Then, for example, I have an Annette who's an otter, who lives with a family near Elk river.

COOPER
We wanted the name of birds.

LUCY
I know but the files are all organized alphabetically.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy, go through the bird file.

JAMES
I don't think I'd be very good company.

DONNA
(over the phone) Well I ... I think we need to talk.

A bell rings from the opening of the front door to the diner. JAMES turns his head to look at who has entered. He sees a dark haired woman walk to the counter of the diner.

DONNA
(over the phone) Uhm ... I found out some things. Audrey told me some stuff and Mrs. Palmer saw something.

JAMES
What?

DONNA
(over the phone) Well if you come over I could tell you.

JAMES
I'm going to get something to eat and then I'll be over in a little bit.

DONNA
(over the phone) Okay, bye.

JAMES hangs up the phone and walks over to the woman. Its MADELEINE standing by the counter waiting for her food order to arrive. JAMES stands right to the side of her and stares at her. At first she doesn't notice but then turns to face him and says ...

MADELEINE
Hi. (removes her glasses)

JAMES
Who are you?

MADELEINE
My name's Madeleine Ferguson. Laura was my cousin.

JAMES
(introduces himself) James Hurley.

MADELEINE
Laura and I hadn't seen each other much ... recently. I live in Missoula. Did you know Laura well?

JAMES
I thought I did. (smiles)

SHELLY
Here you go I got your order ready.

MADELEINE
Thanks a lot.

SHELLY
Mm-hmm.

MADELEINE picks up her food order and holds it in her arms as she speaks to JAMES.

MADELEINE
I'm picking up food for my aunt and uncle. Aunt Sarah can't cook right now and uncle Leland's up half the night listening to old music and crying and stuff ... but if I was cooking for them they'd be doing even worse. (laughs)

JAMES still stares at her.

MADELEINE
You think I look like Laura?

JAMES
Yes. (nods)

MADELEINE
We used to come visit Twin Peaks when I was a kid. It was great. We'd pretend we were sisters. I wish I'd known her better. It's so sad. Well, it was nice to meet you James Hurley.

They shake hands.

JAMES
Nice to meet you too.

BENJAMIN
What's that? No I ... I don't know what you get when you cross a Norwegian and a Swede. (reply) Oh, very good sir, very good. I can't tell you how excited we are about bringing Icelandic investment to the great Northwest. Would you put my brother back on please. Jerry, who the hell is that joker. Your sure that he's the boss. Just make sure they don't start taking eggnog into the pilot. Jerr, I got the jet gassed up and on the runway in Seattle. Usher these guys through customs, make your connections and save me some of whatever it is that their having. (hangs up) Yeah.

He continues to pedal and just barely notices AUDREY at his side.

BENJAMIN
Oh Audrey. I didn't hear you come in. What is it this time?

AUDREY
Daddy are you ashamed of me?

BENJAMIN
Audrey your uh ... your my daughter.

AUDREY
I was thinking about what we were talking about the other night when you were so mad.

BENJAMIN
It isn't that I'm ashamed of you, Audrey. Its just that I'd wish I could depend on you more. Especially during a trying time like this.

AUDREY
Well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Dad, I want to change my life. I've decided I want to help you with the family business. I mean, one of these days you'll need someone to take over and obviously it's not going to be Johnny.

BENJAMIN
(slight laugh) Oh Audrey, I wish that I could believe you.

AUDREY
Daddy please. I saw a friend of mine ... cut down like a flower that had just begun to bloom. Life can be so short. (exhales) There isn't all the time in the world. I see that now and I want to change my life.

BENJAMIN
How exactly?

AUDREY
Well I don't need to go to college. You can teach me the business and I'm willing to start at the absolute bottom.

BENJAMIN
Alright. We've got some guest arriving. You go up stairs and start making some beds.

AUDREY
You still don't believe me.

BENJAMIN
Alright, okay, (stops pedaling) okay, alright, (gets off the motion cycle) alright. (walks away from her towards his desk) Where would you start?

AUDREY
Well I think I should start at the department store. Cosmetics or something. Just part time at first till I graduate.

BENJAMIN
Your really serious aren't you?

AUDREY
You have to start to think about the future daddy. Just like I am.

BENJAMIN
The future?

AUDREY
Our family's future. Please let me be your daughter again.

BENJAMIN
Audrey.

He turns and holds out his arms. AUDREY moves to him and gives him a hug.

TUNE: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

As she hugs her father she sees a photograph of LAURA PALMER and herself, dressed in heavy winter clothing, on his desk. The telephone rings. They separate as BENJAMIN moves over to the phone to answers it.

BENJAMIN
Hello this is Benjamin Horne.

The phone call requires privacy. He covers the mouth piece with his hands and says ...

BENJAMIN
I have to take this sweetheart.

AUDREY
Oh okay. Thanks daddy.

Slowly she walks toward the door but before she exits she turns around to look at him. BENJAMIN peers at her to make sure she's leaves before he talks.

BENJAMIN
Thank you Audrey.

AUDREY finally leaves. BENJAMIN returns to the phone.

BENJAMIN
Where've you been? (reply) Meet me down by the river in a half hour and be discreet.

Nah, he shouldn't have trusted me but like I said Bernie wasn't too bright.

Okay, one last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me.

COOPER
Diane, it is 4:28 am, I have just been woken up by the most god awful racket which you can probably hear over the sound of my voice. (pauses to record the loud singing) Can you hear that? Up until this moment, I've experienced nothing at the Great Northern Hotel but the most pleasant, courteous service imaginable. However, it just goes to prove a point that once a traveler leaves his home he loses almost 100% of his ability to control his environment. Diane I was wondering if you could overnight express to me two pairs of those Ear Pillow silicone ear plugs which I used on my last trip to New York. Naturally I didn't bring them with me on this trip because I didn't feel it would be necessary. However.

As SHERIFF TRUMAN is speaking, COOPER wanders over to the kitchen where a pink box of donuts sits. He opens the box and finds it empty.

COOPER
Harry are there any more donuts?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure. Andy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gives DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN an OK hand sign and a thumbs up pointing to the side meant to be read as 'get more donuts'. COOPER sees it and gives SHERIFF TRUMAN a thumbs up.

Morning doc.

Now DR. HAYWARD is also looking up at the light fixture.

DR. HAYWARD
Um uh the blood on the shirt you found here is AB-. Its not Laura's blood.

COOPER levels his head as he diverts his attention.

COOPER
So it was Jacques Renault's blood on Leo Johnson's shirt.

DR. HAYWARD gives a puzzled look to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who is also mystified by that statement. COOPER returns to staring at the light fixture. The phone rings and DR. HAYWARD moves away to answer it. ANDY comes up to COOPER carrying a donut and a cup of coffee.

COOPER
Oh, thank you Andy.

COOPER takes a bite of the donut and then a sip of coffee. He clearly relishes it. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks up at the light fixture again and soon he has ANDY doing the same thing.

COOPER
What about Leo Johnson? (to ANDY) Could you hold this for a second?

COOPER hands his coffee and donut to ANDY to hold as he grabs a pair of tweezers from his coat pocket.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We think he went out last night. Nothing yet.

ANDY takes a bite of COOPER'S donut.

COOPER
Harry, could you give me a leg up here?

Out of sight we hear DR. HAYWARD on the phone.

DR. HAYWARD
(into phone) Oh, I need you to find out something for me.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sure.

DR. HAYWARD
(into phone) What's Jacques Renault's blood type?

SHERIFF TRUMAN cups his hands so COOPER can place his foot there. COOPER sets his foot and SHERIFF TRUMAN lifts him up slightly as COOPER takes a step up to reach the light fixture.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Allyy-oop.

We see DR. HAYWARD with a surprised look on his face as he says ...

DR. HAYWARD
Jacques Renault's blood is AB-.

COOPER
Thanks doc.

DR. HAYWARD
My pleasure.

When COOPER comes back down he holds in his tweezers a copy of Fleshworld, a swingers magazine.

TUNE: AUDREY'S DANCE (0:00 - 0:10 W/O SNAPS)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Holy smoke, Fleshworld again.

COOPER
Yeah. Harry remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski?

They both move over to a nearby table. COOPER thumbs through the magazine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We traced that ad. It came in a magazine in a plain envelope, no name.

COOPER
The magazine's a clearing house. Readers write letters in response to the ads and mail them into the magazine. The magazine forwards them on to the advertisers. (finds an envelope in the magazine; looks at TRUMAN) No direct contact. (looks at the envelope) Ronette received her letters at this post office box.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's a local zip code.

COOPER
Well my guess is that this post office box will be registered under the name of Jacques Renault. (looks at TRUMAN) Lets see who's writing to Ronette. Post marked Georgia

SHERIFF TRUMAN rolls his eyes and looks away. DR. HAYWARD walks up to them. COOPER opens the envelope and pulls out a photograph that he and DR. HAYWARD look at.

DR. HAYWARD
Good night. (dismayed)

COOPER
I don't know. The beard sort of ruins the effect of the lingerie. What do you think?

COOPER hands the photo to SHERIFF TRUMAN to look at it.

In the kitchen, we see SHELLY JOHNSON, wearing a robe, carrying two plates of food to the table. BOBBY BRIGGS sits at table smoking a cigarette. She places one of the plates in front of BOBBY and the other at an open chair for herself.

BOBBY
I love it when you cook for me.

SHELLY
Leo hates my cooking.

She returns to the stove.

BOBBY
Leo missed the boat with you baby. The biggest mistake of your life was dropping out of the eleventh grade and marrying that roadhog.

By the stove, she turns to face him, smiles and says ...

SHELLY
What would you do if he walked in right now?

BOBBY
Come here.

SHELLY moves over to him.

BOBBY
Come here.

He grabs the belt on her robe, pulls her next to him and sets her down on his lap. She laughs slightly and he kisses her. He reaches into her robe pocket and pulls out the gun she bought. He pretends to point it as if LEO was across the table.

BOBBY
Hey Leo. How's it going man? (SHELLY laughs) What a surprise. Now Leo, Shelly tells me that you don't like her cooking. I'll tell you what. She and I, we're gonna sit here. While you cook breakfast for us, you hump. And if you so much as utter one harsh syllable to this ... (turns to SHELLY) beautiful girl. (turns to pretend Leo) I'm going to shoot your ugly face off, okay man.

TUNE ENDS: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (1:12 - 2:11)

They laugh until they hear a car door slams outside. Spooked, BOBBY and SHELLY quickly look at each other, stand up and move to the window to see who it is.

BOBBY
(relieved) Ohh, the sheriff's deputy. Now Shelly do exactly what we said and everything gonna be fine. Okay.

SHELLY nods and they kiss. BOBBY starts to move away but returns to her for one more kiss before he hides just outside behind the rear door. Nervous, SHELLY takes a few puffs from a cigarette. The door bell rings and SHELLY moves to answer it. BOBBY peers inside through a window in the door. SHELLY turns to look at him before she opens the front door.

SHELLY
Oh hi Andy. Come on in.

ANDY
(walks in) Hi Shelly. Do you know when Leo might be back?

SHELLY
Uh-uh. Is he in some kind of trouble?

ANDY
No, we just want to talk to him.

As they talk, our view switches to seeing BOBBY smile as he watches them and listens on.

SHELLY
This wouldn't be about Laura would it?

ANDY
Why do you say that?

SHELLY
Well I-I heard him talking to this guy Jacques the night he left.

ANDY
Jacques Renault?

SHELLY
Yeah, um they were outside arguing. I couldn't hear exactly but they did seem to be arguing about her and then they drove off together.

ANDY
Shelly, you call us the minute he gets in touch with you.

SHELLY
Okay, I will. Thanks for stopping by.

ANDY walks out. SHELLY closes the door, leans against the back of the door and smiles as she looks over to BOBBY. She walks over to BOBBY. He reenters the kitchen. She hops into his arms, he picks her up and holds her.

SHELLY
How I do?

BOBBY
You did great.

In the kitchen, they spin around and kiss.

BOBBY
Your driving me crazy.

BOBBY moves to the kitchen counter by the sink and places her on the countertop. ANDY'S police cruiser can be heard driving off outside. The phone rings. BOBBY, kissing her neck, picks it up and holds it at SHELLY'S mouth and ear for her to answer it.

SHELLY
Hello. (she grabs the phone and pushes BOBBY away) Hi Leo. Where you calling from?

LEO
(over the phone) Did anybody come by?

Listening on, BOBBY motions to her to say 'no'.

SHELLY
What's that? Is anybody looking for you? Why would anybody be looking for you?

LEO
(over the phone) Are you sure?

SHELLY
You know how paranoid you get when you been popping vendies on the road a couple of days. So when are you coming home

LEO
(over the phone) Soon. Everything okay?

SHELLY
Yeah, everything fine Leo.

NORMA
Hope you don't mind my coming.

BIG ED
Oh no.

He walks to her and meets her halfway. Together they walk to a nearby tow truck. NORMA has her hands in her coat pocket. BIG ED holds onto her left arm as they walk.

BIG ED
Nadine won't be back from that patent attorney over there in Fairvale for a couple of hours.

NORMA

NORMA
Well I have to put gas in my car like everyone else, right.

BIG ED

NORMA
I didn't want to tell you on the phone ... but Hank got his parole.

BIG ED
Okay.

Now behind the tow truck, they turn to face each other. They lose their smiles. BIG ED looks disappointed.

NORMA
He'll be coming home. I mean back. I only saw him a minute before the hearing. He seemed so hopeful. I didn't want to say anything.

BIG ED
You don't have to explain.

NORMA
Have you said anything to Nadine yet?

Maybe that's our trouble Ed. We never want to hurt anyone. We never just take what we want. There's a part of me that's beginning to think that ... this is how it is when you get to the end of your life ... and that you don't have anything to show for it.

BIG ED

NORMA
Don't call me. I mean ... not for a while, okay.

(grabs his tie) Because if you don't I'm going to rip my dress in half and scream at the top of my lungs and tell my father that you made a pass at me. Does that help to clear things up for you?

JAMES moves to her and they hug. They move apart slightly.

JAMES
Donna, there's some things I gotta say. I told you that my dad died when I was ten. He didn't die. He was a musician. We were living on the West coast. He was a bum and ran off on me and my mom.

DONNA
I'm sorry.

JAMES
My mom is a writer. She was really good; poems and short stories. She's an alcoholic. If you have a problem with this I know you didn't ask to hear it.

DONNA
(nods no) I don't have a problem. You tell me.

JAMES
Its true, she was out of town this week but ... she wasn't traveling. What she does is, she goes to another town, shacks up in some cheap hotel with a couple of bottles and (look away) ... picks up guys and ...

Tears form in his eyes. He walks away, still in the gazebo, to look at the lake. DONNA moves to him and hugs him from behind.

DONNA
Its alright.

JAMES
I'm telling you this because I don't want to have any secrets from you. I don't want there to be any lies between us. (turns to face her) Its the secrets people keep that destroy any chance they have of happiness and I don't want us to be like that.

DONNA
We won't will we.

Madeleine, if I said that you can't really say a word of this to anyone, not a soul. Not even your aunt or uncle. Would that be okay with you?

It is. James and I knew Laura better than anyone did. She was in some kind of terrible trouble before she died. Worse then any of us can imagine.

DONNA
Well I rather not say to much about things we can't prove yet.

MADELEINE
You said you can't prove it 'yet'?

DONNA
We loved Laura. We're afraid that the truth might never come out or that the person who killed her might never be caught. We've sworn on her memory not to let that happen.

JAMES
We have some ideas.

DONNA
We wanted to talk to you about this because we need your help.

MADELEINE
What do you want me to do?

DONNA
Laura used to talk about a secret hiding place she had somewhere in her house. Maybe in her room. I'm not really sure but nobody else knew about it. We think she might have left something there that could lead us to the killer.

MADELEINE
(nods yes) I'll help you.

You will.

DEPUTY HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and DR. HAYWARD are hiking in the woods. HAWK leads the way. COOPER wears an FBI labeled jacket. SHERIFF TRUMAN carries a rifle. DR. HAYWARD, wearing a hat and coat, follows several paces behind using a large wooden pole, as a hiking stick, to help him along. The area of forest they are walking through is desolate, hilly and has many pine trees.

HAWK
This way. Through here.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(jokingly) Watch your step there city boy.

COOPER
Thanks Harry.




CUT TO:

EXT. RAVEN - DAY

We watch a raven land and perch onto a tree branch.




CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Leading the group, HAWK finds a very young pine tree snapped. A sign that someone or something has passed by. HAWK put a hand up for them to stop.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What is it Hawk?

HAWK looks it over, turns to the group and then walks on. The group follows.




CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - DAY

From a distance, we view a log cabin surrounded by the woods.




CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

All but DR. HAYWARD, who is still trying to catch up, stand together looking at the cabin.

COOPER
Not the cabin we're looking for.

HAWK
Maybe, maybe not.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Might want to hang back a step doc.

DR. HAYWARD
Huh, might want to anyway.

DR. HAYWARD stops just short of them and leans on his pole as he breathes heavily. SHERIFF TRUMAN turns to check on him and shows some concern. DEPUTY HAWK pulls his gun out of his holster.

TUNE ENDS: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    




CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - DAY

They all reach the side of the cabin and slowly, with guns drawn, walk outside the exterior log wall toward the front of the cabin. As they pass a window they duck down slightly. Unexpectedly, the 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN, holding her log, walks around the corner and meets them face to face. Caught off guard HAWK, TRUMAN and COOPER all point their weapons at her.

LOG LADY
'Bout time you got here. They move so slowly when their not afraid.

She walks off around the corner. Under the porch of the cabin, she turns and sees that HAWK, COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD are hanging back a distance away.

LOG LADY
Come on then. My log does not judge.

She walks into her cabin.




CUT TO:

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

From inside the cabin we watch SHERIFF TRUMAN put his rifle down and DR. HAYWARD puts his walking stick down on a bench just outside the door way. A teapot can be heard whistling from the stove. HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DR. HAYWARD enter but stand near the door. COOPER stands underneath the doorway, just behind them. The LOG LADY pours the hot water from the kettle into a teapot.

LOG LADY
I've got tea. I've got cookies. No cake.

COOPER
That's very kind of you ma'am but I don't believe that we...

HAWK puts his hand up to silence COOPER.

HAWK
What kind of cookies?

LOG LADY
Sugar. The owls won't see us in here.

HAWK turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN, nods and moves to take a seat at the table. DR. HAYWARD follows suit.

DR. HAYWARD
(removes his hat) Cup'a tea would be very nice.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN are still at the door. COOPER moves to talk to him but is interrupted by ...

LOG LADY
Shut your eyes and you'll burst into flames.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smiles) Thanks Margaret.

The LOG LADY places the teapot onto the table and sits down. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER move to take a seat at the table.

LOG LADY
We'll let it steep.

COOPER moves to grab a sugar cookie from a nearby tray. The LOG LADY slaps his hand as he touches a cookie.

LOG LADY
Wait for the tea. The fish aren't running.

HAWK grins at him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You've been expecting us Margaret?

LOG LADY
Your two days late ... but that's your concern. My log saw something. Something significant.

COOPER
What did your log see?

LOG LADY
Tea first. Then be ready.

She pours each of them a cup of tea.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(after she pours him some tea) Thanks.

LOG LADY
My husband was a logging man.

COOPER
Oh.

LOG LADY
He met the devil. Fire is the devil hiding like a coward in the smoke.

DR. HAYWARD
It was the day after the wedding. Wasn't it Margaret?

HAWK
The wood holds many spirits. Doesn't it Margaret?

The LOG LADY picks up her log off the floor beside her, puts it in her arms and holds it towards COOPER.

LOG LADY
You can ask it now.

COOPER looks to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who nods to him to go on. COOPER bends slightly toward the log and says ...

TUNE: WALKING IN THE DARK (MIX)

COOPER
What did you see that night? The night Laura Palmer was killed.

LOG LADY
Sshhh, (pats the log) I'll do the talking. Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. Many things were blocked. Laughing. Two men, two girls. Flashlights pass by in the woods over the ridge. The owls were near. The dark was-was pressing in on her. Quiet then. Later, footsteps. One man pass by. Screams far away. Terrible, terrible. One voice.

COOPER
Man or girl?

LOG LADY
Girl. Further up, over the ridge. The owls were silent.

TUNE: WALKING IN THE DARK (MIX)




CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

DEPUTY HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and DR. HAYWARD are again hiking in the woods. HAWK leads the way and DR. HAYWARD still follows several paces behind. A woodpecker pecking and a raven cawing can be heard.

SONG: INTO THE NIGHT

COOPER
The two girls were Laura and Ronette.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The two men Jacques ... maybe Leo.

COOPER
Maybe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who's the third man?

HAWK stops and they all follow suit.

HAWK
Do you hear it?

They all hear a song drifting through the air.

HAWK
(points) This way.




CUT TO:

EXT. PERCHED RAVEN - DAY

We watch a raven, perched high on a tree top, fly off.

CUT TO:

We view AGENT COOPER'S profile. One by one, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK and DR. HAYWARD step into view. The end result is a stacked view of each of their profiles as they look at the cabin.




CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - DAY

We view the front of the cabin. It looks exactly like the one in the photograph.




CUT TO:

RAVEN

We view a CLOSEUP of a raven's eye. We ZOOM OUT as we hear the song.

SONG LYRICS
Into the night. I cry out. I cry out your name.




CUT TO:

EXT. JACQUES RENAULT'S CABIN - DAY

They have come upon the cabin they were looking for. The cabin from the photograph in JACQUES apartment. Just below it, near a stone foundation, HAWK and TRUMAN point their guns at the ready. COOPER removes his gun from his holster. SHERIFF TRUMAN gives DR. HAYWARD a hand signal to stay put. DR. HAYWARD takes a seat on the ground to catch his breath as the rest move toward the cabin with their guns drawn.




CUT TO:

INT. JACQUES RENAULT'S CABIN - DAY

The song comes to an end but the record player, with an automated stylus, replays the song it has been playing. We watch HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER burst into the cabin with their guns drawn. They quickly scan the room, find it empty and puts their guns away before scattering throughout the cabin.

SONG LYRICS
Into the night. Shadows fall, shadows ...

COOPER moves to the record player. Using his tweezers he lifts the stylus from the record, puts it in its cradle and says ...

SONG ENDS: INTO THE NIGHT

COOPER
And there's always music in the air.

SHERIFF TRUMAN lifts the cover off an object, where a bird can be heard, and finds a mynah bird in its bird cage. The bird cage has a name plaque. He reads it out loud.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Waldo.

DEPUTY HAWK has moved over to a camera on a tripod. He opens the camera.

HAWK
There's film in here.

Using a handkerchief, HAWK removes the film canister. We see COOPER put on some latex gloves and move to the floor to inspect a roll of twine. HAWK has now moved to another area and finds ...

HAWK
Blood.

A cuckoo clock go off but the cuckoo clock bird is not popping out like it should. SHERIFF TRUMAN walks up to it, opens one of the little doors and a bunch of poker chips fall out. Kneeling on the floor, COOPER watches one of the poker chips roll under a chair. COOPER walks over to it and picks it up.

INT. TIMBER ROOM - NIGHT

We view a sign above the double doors to the room. It says 'Timber Room'. We PAN down to see a couple, MR. and MRS. SCHOLPF, open the doors to the room. A HOSTESS, dressed in a Viking costume and wearing a Viking helmet, stands by the door to greet and check people into the party. Behind her we see the party being held to welcome the Icelandic business group to Twin Peaks.

MR. SCHOLPF
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Scholpf.

The HOSTESS looks over the sheet and nods for them to enter. CATHERINE MARTELL and PETE MARTELL are next to be greeted.

HOSTESS
Good evening.

CATHERINE
Catherine Martell and spouse.

PETE looks at her, bothered by the way she addressed him. They walk into the room.

PETE
Go easy on the sauce tonight okay Cathy.

CATHERINE immediately picks up two glasses of champagne from a nearby tray a waiter is holding. She downs one of the glasses, turns to PETE and says ...

CATHERINE
Couple of belts and even you may start to look good to me.

She walks off. PETE, in his good natured way, just smiles. He looks around the room.

At the buffet table MAJOR BRIGGS, as he serves himself food, speaks to the Icelandic business group leader, MR. EINAR THORSON.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Of course the modern age has changed forever the way your people live, Mr. Thorson. It would be my guess that there still remains a tremendous vestigial of interest in the legends and folklore of ancient Iceland.

MR. THORSON
Vestigial. Absolutely.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER ROOM - NIGHT

JERRY talks to HEBA, a tall, beautiful blonde, who stands against a log column holding a plate of food.

JERRY

JERRY
Hepa, Hepa. You've never heard that before?

HEBA

JERRY
Did you realize the incredible potential that could result from our taking a mutual dip in each other's respective gene pools. (HEBA laughs) Heba, I want to cook for you.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER ROOM - NIGHT

In bursting laughter, we see BENJAMIN talking to several members of the Icelandic GROUP. From the bar, we see CATHERINE down another glass of champagne. She grabs another glass and walks over to him.

BENJAMIN
So he says. What do you get when you cross a Norwegian with a Swede? A socialist who wants to be king. (group laughs)

CATHERINE is now beside BENJAMIN, listening.

BENJAMIN
Well I can remember it was I think oh ... somewhere in the '50s I came ... (CATHERINE tries to get his attention by clearing her throat) I came through your country. Beautiful, beautiful. Not many trees though you know but ...

From her glass, CATHERINE pours a little bit of her champagne on BENJAMIN'S shoe. She gets his attention and group's as well as they all quiet down. BENJAMIN looks down at his shoe and taps his wet foot. He turns to look at CATHERINE and then back to the GROUP.

BENJAMIN
Would you excuse me.

GROUP
(severally) Of course ... yeah ... sure.

BENJAMIN and CATHERINE walk together away from the GROUP.

BENJAMIN
Meet me at my office. Give me uh ... two minutes to break away.

CATHERINE
Hell hath no fury.

BENJAMIN
What? Two minutes.

He walks away from her. We PAN to see AUDREY, leaning against a wood column. She has seen the incident with her father and CATHERINE. She watches CATHERINE walk down the hallway toward her father's office. We hear BENJAMIN in the background.

BENJAMIN
Ah, Thor. I've been meaning to ask you. Are you familiar with the work of Knut Hamsun?

AUDREY moves down the hall near the HORNE residency and pulls a ring in bedded in the wall that reveals a small panel door.

INT. AUDREY'S SECRET SPY HOLE - DAY

She enters a small space within the walls between the hallway and the HORNE residency. Out of sight but in BENJAMIN HORNE'S office we hear BENJAMIN and CATHERINE as AUDREY moves within the small space to her spy hole. AUDREY removes a wood panel from the wall to reveal a knot hole in the wood wall in the other room.

BENJAMIN
We agreed. No scenes in front of the guests. Lets keep the melodrama to a minimum. The next thing I know your polishing my shoes with Dom Perigon. Fill me in. What's eating you?

We see AUDREY'S POV of CATHERINE speaking to BENJAMIN in his office.

CATHERINE
Why do you have this thousand poker chip from you know where in your pants yesterday? I thought you preferred women with a certain experience.

She holds it up for him to see. He takes the chip and looks it over as if he wasn't sure what it was.

BENJAMIN
Uhm. Jerry gave me that.

CATHERINE slaps him across the face with her right hand. We see AUDREY silently laugh.

BENJAMIN
Its a good luck charm. I thought I lost it. I'm so relieved ... that you found it.

CATHERINE slaps him across the face with her left hand.

BENJAMIN
Are you quite finished?

Again she slaps him across the face but with her right hand.

CATHERINE
Yes.

BENJAMIN
In that case.

BENJAMIN grabs her by the arms and kisses her. They both hug each other, kiss and CATHERINE lays back on his desk. AUDREY is no longer smiling as she watches them.

CATHERINE
Oh, lets burn the mill. Lets do it tonight.

BENJAMIN
No my love. We'll give Josie one last chance to sell, tomorrow. (moves off CATHERINE and stands up) Failing that, I have retained the services of a qualified professional.

BENJAMIN reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of mints and offers one to CATHERINE.

BENJAMIN
Breath mint?

AUDREY replaces the wood slat cover. Disturbed by what she saw and heard, she laughs to herself.

PETE, holding a glass mug full of milk and wearing a napkin like a bib, talks to MR. THORSON, who is holding a plate of food.

PETE
Now let me get this straight. Your entire country is above the timber line.

They are interrupted as JERRY, using a microphone, gets the crowds attention. HEBA stands behind him in the background.

JERRY
Folks, ladies and gentlemen can I have your attention please.

SONG ENDS: ICELANDER IV

The singing stops and the crowd quiets down.

JERRY
Can I have your attention.

The microphone crackles. He taps it on a edge of a podium that generates some amplified distortion but it all clears up. JERRY laughs.

JERRY
First off, I want to thank you all for turning out to welcome our neighbors from the magical isle of Iceland. (says an Icelander sentence then repeats it in English) We are all Icelanders.

The crowd claps and JERRY laughs. We see LELAND in the crowd listening on.

JERRY
The Ghostwood Estates project is an important part of our future here in Twin Peaks and there's no one we'd rather ...

TUNE: IN THE MOOD   28K

As JERRY speaks, a big band tune unexpectedly and unintentionally starts up. People in crowd look around unsure of what is going on. We see that BENJAMIN and CATHERINE have returned to the party.

JERRY
... have as partners in our future then ... (looks around) What?

We view LELAND cringe and moan at hearing the big band tune. He irrationally begins to dance, holding his hands in place as if he was dancing with a partner. Alone on the dance floor, people start to look at him. BENJAMIN sees him and his furious. He doesn't want LELAND to upset or frighten his guests so he tells CATHERINE ...

BENJAMIN
Dance with him. (she gives him a questioning look) It is serious. Dance with him.

CATHERINE complies. She takes off her shoes, moves over to LELAND, grabs his hands and starts to dance with him. People watch them and several of them can be heard. BENJAMIN waves to JERRY to come over.

PARTY GUEST #1
Alright.

Confused, JERRY puts the microphone down and walks over to BENJAMIN.

PARTY GUEST #2
Jerry, what's going on?

PARTY GUEST #3
Yeah.

BENJAMIN
(to JERRY, now beside him) Get Jacoby, get a net but get him (points of LELAND) out of my life.

LELAND stops dancing but he puts his hands to his head and starts to cry. CATHERINE doesn't know what to do at first but, being a little drunk, mimics him by placing her hands to her head. With both hands on her head she starts to pat her head with both hands treating LELAND'S distress like some odd dance move. HEBA, dancing with JERRY, sees them and start to duplicate the dance. Soon everyone is doing it including BENJAMIN, who is dancing with a women from the Icelandic group. Behind a wood column, AUDREY cries at the sight of LELAND suffering on the dance floor.

In a truck, LEO parks, gets out and walks to the outside wall of his house. He lifts a latch that opens a storage compartment built into the outside wall. He pulls out two 5 gallon gasoline cans. He closes the storage doors, picks up the gas cans, walks over to his truck and puts them in. As he turns around, he is suddenly punched in the face, the stomach, again in the face and then is jerked to the ground. LEO, flat on his back, lays quietly as HANK, in a black leather jacket, stands over him grabbing at LEO'S jacket.

HANK
I told you to mind the store Leo not open your own franchise.

LEO
Hank I ...

HANK
Do as your told Leo. Next time, you watch me take your little chippy apart before I kill ya'.

HANK lets go of his jacket and walks away nearly stepping on his head. LEO coughs trying to catch his breath.




CUT TO:

LEO walks inside through the kitchen entrance. As he enters we see that his face has been cut up and is a little bloody. He moves to the kitchen sink. SHELLY sees him and, shocked and concerned, rushes to him.

LEO

SHELLY
Honey what happened? Are you okay?

LEO
JUST GET ME A DAMN BEER! (shoves her to the ground)

SHELLY scrambles for the gun in the pocket of her robe. Still on the ground, she pulls it out, holds it securely between both of her hands and aims it at LEO.

LEO
Get up and ...

LEO sees her with the gun and nearly starts to laugh.

LEO
(smiling) What the hell are you doing with that?

SHELLY
Your not going to hurt me again. Don't touch me. Don't come near me Leo.

LEO
You stupid little SLUT!

SHELLY cocks the gun to fire by pulling the hammer back with her thumb.

LEO
You haven't got the guts.

LEO starts to move towards her. SHELLY closes her eyes and pulls the trigger. It discharges and hits LEO. Loudly, we hear LEO grunt like an animal in pain. SHELLY throws the gun to the floor, covers her eyes and cries out in fear. We hear the kitchen door slam shut.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Yet there are those who open many eyes. Eyes are the mirror of the soul, someone has said. So we look closely at the eyes to see the nature of the soul.

AUDREY
So do you want me to leave or what?

COOPER takes a deep breath as he ponders what to say.

COOPER
What I want and what I need are two different things Audrey.

COOPER takes another deep breath.

COOPER
When a man joins the bureau he takes an oath to uphold certain values. Values that he’s sworn to live by. This is wrong Audrey, we both know it.

AUDREY
But don’t you like me?

COOPER
I like you very much. Your beautiful, intelligent, desirable. Your everything a man wants in his life. But what you need right now, more then anything else, is a friend. Someone who will listen.

AUDREY wipes tears from her eyes. COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handkerchief for her.

AUDREY
Friends huh.

COOPER nods yes. AUDREY brightens with a smile. COOPER returns with a smile.

COOPER
Now I’m going to go down and get us two malts and some fries downstairs. Then I want you to tell me all your troubles.

AUDREY
That could take all night.

COOPER
The night is young.

COOPER stands up.

COOPER
Now I’m going to get the food ... and your going to get dressed.

In the conference room, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN stands beside the table opposite a bird cage. DR. WILL HAYWARD stands at the end of the table bent over an encyclopedia. Near the table hanging from a stand is a bird cage with WALDO, the mynah bird, from JACQUES RENAULT’S cabin. AGENT COOPER walks into the room and stands near the window and the bird cage.

DR. HAYWARD
Alright I found it. Gracula Religiosa. Commonly known as the hill mynah. Native to Southeast Asia-Indonesia. Feeds on fruit mainly. Some invertebrates. Its ability to mimic the human voice is amazing.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah well so far we haven’t heard a peep.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks to the bird cage.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey Waldo what’s up.

DR. HAYWARD
Well it says here that mimicry is a kind of play with the mynah. But this one’s in a weakened condition; starved, dehydrated. I’d say he’s feeling anything but playful.

DR. HAYWARD picks up a grape.

DR. HAYWARD
Here ya’ go little fella.

DR. HAYWARD moves to feed the grape to WALDO but sees COOPER staring at the bird.

DR. HAYWARD
Oh, you wanna feed him Agent Cooper?

COOPER
I don’t like birds.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
When do you think he’ll start talking again?

DR. HAYWARD
Well, according to the book his urge to mimic should return with his good health.

COOPER
If it does then we got a witness.

DR. HAYWARD
Well we better keep feeding him.

DR. HAYWARD sourly looks at the grape and then turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

DR. HAYWARD
You got any apples?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. There’s some at the bottom of the fridge.

DR. HAYWARD
These grapes are right on the edge.

DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL enters the room carrying a file.

HAWK
These just came in from your office.

HAWK hands the file to COOPER, who looks it over. COOPER moves over to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Hmm. Forensics confirms that Jacques Renault had three guests to his cabin; Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson.

COOPER looks at the back of a large photograph. The photograph is marked with a stamp as evidence. COOPER flips the photograph over to look at the image.

COOPER
This is the only exposed negative on that roll of film Harry. Look familiar?

COOPER hands the photo to SHERIFF TRUMAN. SHERIFF TRUMAN scans the photograph and smiles.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That’s our Waldo.

COOPER
No Harry, the girl. That’s Laura.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gives a puzzled look and looks at the photograph again.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we view a CLOSE-UP of the photograph. The picture is of WALDO perched on the shoulder of a WOMAN with blonde hair.


BACK TO SCENE:

Unsure which end is up, SHERIFF TRUMAN turns the photograph around as he continues to look it over.

COOPER
Well, now we know who and when. We don’t know why.

COOPER stacks some books under the bird cage. COOPER then pulls his mini tape recorder out of his pocket and shows it to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Voice activated Harry.

With a CLICK, COOPER turns the mini recorder on.

COOPER
When the bird talks maybe we’ll get some answers.

COOPER places his mini tape recorder on the stack of books right below the bird cage. COOPER picks up a file from the folder and hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN. Paper clipped to the file is a plastic bag containing the notched poker chip.

COOPER
Albert confirmed that this matches the fragment found in Laura’s stomach.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thousand dollar chip from One-Eyed Jacks.

HAWK
Jacques Renault’s working there. Dealing in the casino.

COOPER
Well, I think a little field work is in order.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jacks is over the border. A little out of our jurisdiction.

COOPER
Well I know that Harry. That’s why I was thinking this would be a good job for the Bookhouse Boys.

SHERIFF TRUMAN understands and smiles.

I guess I feel I can say anything. All my secrets. The naked ones. I know you like those doc. I know you like me too. That’ll be my little secret okay. Just like your coconut.

AUDREY
Fruity.

CUSTOMER
As in fruit.

MR. EMORY BATTIS, the store vice-president, walks up to the perfume counter and talks to JENNY, a salesgirl working with AUDREY. AUDREY searches for another fragrance for the CUSTOMER but, standing near JENNY, is more interested in listening in on JENNY’S and BATTIS’S discussion.

EMORY
Could I see you in my office in five minutes?

JENNY
Sure.

EMORY walks off.

CUSTOMER
I’m not making myself clear. I want a scent that makes a statement.

AUDREY
Maybe you should try hanging it around your neck. Its a perfume, its a fashion accessory. Two statements for the price of one.

CUSTOMER
I don’t appreciate your attitude.

The CUSTOMER walks away.

JENNY
Wow, a unicorn.

EMORY
Jenny, you had a good time at the club last week didn’t you?

HANK
Yeah, I’m a little better at faces then names I guess.

The COOK rings the service bell and SHELLY moves off to pick up the order.

HANK
(sinisterly) Yeah, Big Ed.

HANK looks down at the counter where he sees a lighter someone had left behind their plate of food. With his shifty eyes, HANK glances around, casually moves his hand, picks up the lighter and puts it in his back pocket. HANK then moves the dirty plates to a bin.

At the front door, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER enter the diner. SHERIFF TRUMAN spots HANK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

SHELLY moves to the coffee dispenser. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN are still standing by the counter as they talk.

COOPER
Harry, I’m going to let you in on a little secret. Everyday, once a day, give yourself a present. Don’t plan it, don’t wait for it, just let it happen.

SHELLY places two cups of coffee on the counter near them.

COOPER
It could be a new shirt at the men store, a catnap in your office chair or ...

COOPER gestures to the cups of coffee on the counter before them.

COOPER
... two cups of good hot black coffee. Like this.

COOPER wears a large grin. SHERIFF TRUMAN grins back.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A present? Like Christmas?

COOPER nods yes. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN both move to the counter and take a seat where their coffee has been placed. COOPER grabs his cup and takes a sip. SHERIFF TRUMAN watches COOPER.

COOPER
Ahh man that hits the spot.

SHERIFF TRUMAN grins at COOPER’S reaction. SHERIFF TRUMAN hasn’t touched his cup yet. COOPER slides it over to him.

Now refresh my memory. What policy is this?

He pulls out an expanding folder from his briefcase and takes out a document.

Your new life insurance. Since the binder takes effect at midnight tonight I really had no choice. You see, it just couldn’t wait until tomorrow.

Are you suggesting that there’s something ... irregular at work here?

MR. NEV
I certainly never got that idea from Mrs. Packard, no. Or from Mr. Horne for that matter either. When he offered to collect your signatures I thought it was fine. Just with a new account, I like to be certain to (gestures with the pen as if to cross a ‘T’) cross every ‘T’.

Again he shows her where to sign on the document.

MR. NEV
Right here please.

CATHERINE
You know, I’m noticing that there’s some ... minor changes that I asked my attorney to make that are not included in this draft. I think what I’d like to do is go over this with him on the phone in the morning, and initial the changes and get the completed documents to you at that time.

As she does, she spots a new hotel guest, a thin ASIAN MAN, being helped to his room by a BELL BOY. As she passes him, the ASIAN MAN bows his head to her.

COOPER
Ed, why don’t you open that up.

BIG ED opens a briefcase laying on the table. Inside the briefcase we see several moustaches and wigs.

BIG ED
Wow, look at all this.

We PAN to see AGENT COOPER and HAWK. COOPER lets out an ‘ouch’ as HAWK applies tape to a microphone wire on his upper left arm.

HAWK
Sorry.

We ZOOM out to see them all.

COOPER
There’s a curly haired wig in there Ed. It’s gonna work like gangbusters ... and I’ll help you out with one of those moustaches.

BIG ED
Think it’ll fit? I’ve got a big head.

HAWK finishes installing COOPER microphone.

HAWK
Okay, give it a try.

BIG ED moves the curly wig to his head to try it on. COOPER rolls his long sleeve shirt down, lifts his wrist near to his mouth and says ...

COOPER
Testing one two.

The speaker from the receiver duplicates what he says but ends with a very loud swoop of distortion from over amplification. COOPER grabs his wrist and all remain silent.

With their guns drawn, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER meet in the hallway near the door to the conference room. They enter the conference room and lower their guns as they see what was shot, WALDO. DEPUTY HAWK, DEPUTY ANDY, BIG ED and LUCY follow behind them.

BIG ED
What happened?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody shot Waldo. Ah geez.

ANDY
Poor Waldo.

COOPER picks up his mini tape recorder that was set to automatically record on voice activation. He rewinds the tape a bit and plays it. From the tape recorder we hear ...

BIG ED
What happened?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody shot Waldo.

COOPER stops the tape, rewinds it some more and hits play. We hear ...

LUCY
Birdie birdie birdie. Want some orange? Come on lets share.

LUCY, standing by the window with ANDY, looks away slightly embarrassed. Again COOPER stops the tape, rewinds it and hits play. This time we hear ...

COOPER and BIG ED return the stare as she walks by.

COOPER
Casino’s probably in the back. If Jacques dealing that’s where we’ll find him.

Ah, I’ve got a Chevy parked out back with a serious root canal problem. Wanna take a look?

JERRY tells them to go to the dining room in their language. He kisses HEBA, who is standing right beside him, on both cheeks.

JERRY

The Icelander group leave the room. JERRY, holding a very large pine cone in his left hand, takes a seat on BEN’S desk.

JERRY

JERRY puts the pine cone down on BEN’S desk, grabs the tub of ice cream and a spoon and starts eating.

Uh-huh. Yeah. So, what’s the catch?

BEN and JERRY are now both spooning out ice cream from the same tub.

JERRY
More fun. Signing party. They wanna finalize the deal at One-Eyed Jacks.

BEN pulls the tub of ice cream away from JERRY as he moves his spoon towards it.

BENJAMIN
How’d they find out about Jacks?

JERRY

BENJAMIN
Ahh. Jerry, Jerry. Get ’em back on the van. (nods and smiles)

JERRY

JERRY throws his spoon in the tub of ice cream and picks up his mug of beer. As JERRY walks toward the door he trips on a step but regains his balance. He looks at BEN and laughs at himself.

JERRY

From the next room the Icelander group can be heard yelling.

AUDREY lifts the cherry to her mouth, bites the cherry off and eats it while still holding onto the cherry stem. Next, she puts the cherry stem into her mouth. Her eyes roll and her lips squirm as she contorts her tongue into weaving the cherry stem into a knot. Finished, she pulls out the knotted stem and places it on the napkin the drink was on. BLACKIE interest has been piqued. She bends forward to take a closer look, sits back and pulls out a document and pen from one of her desk drawers.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO: ROULETTE WHEEL

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

As the last scene, the TIGHT FOCUS on DR. JACOBY’S left eye, FADES OUT we FADE IN to FOCUS on a top view of a spinning roulette wheel. A white marble is dropped in and bounces around for a while until it stops in a marked crevice.

DEALER (OFF SCREEN)
Red 36.

BACK TO SCENE:

Beside the roulette table stands ‘BIG’ ED HURLEY dressed in his undercover garb of a western outfit, wig and moustache. Standing next to him is one the establishments 52‘ PICK-UPS, a hospitality girl.

52 PICK-UP #1
Sorry Mister, I guess our date’s off.

BIG ED shrugs and walks away from the roulette table. People can be heard placing bets and laughing. BIG ED passes FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER as he walks through the casino. AGENT COOPER is seated at a Black Jack table. JACQUES RENAULT is the dealer. We FOCUS on COOPER and JACQUES as BIG ED walks off. JACQUES speaks with a slight French-Canadian accent.

JACQUES
Sir are you absolutely sure you want another card?

COOPER
Yes please.

JACQUES pulls another card from the deck and places it face up, the deuce of hearts. COOPER flips over his one card laying face down to reveal that he has ...

COOPER
Twenty-one. Can you beat that?

JACQUES turns his one card laying face down to reveal a pair of kings for 20. COOPER wins the hand.

COOPER
Mother always said I was born lucky.

JACQUES shuffles the deck as a 52’ PICK-UP #2, walks up to COOPER, cups her hand around his ear and whispers something. COOPER reaches up and places a poker chip in her hand.

COOPER
Maybe later. Thanks for asking.

She purses her lips and walks off. JACQUES grins and moves his eyebrows up and down with a gesture to the woman.

COOPER
This is for you.

COOPER slides a poker chip on the table towards JACQUES. The poker chip is a thousand dollar chip with a notch in it, the chip from his cabin. JACQUES looks it over and his eyes brighten.

COOPER
I’m a friend of Leo’s.

JACQUES
Who’s Leo?

COOPER
Buy you a cocktail Jacques?

Seated at her office desk, BLACKIE ‘THE BLACK ROSE’ O’REILLY is playing a hand of solitaire.

BLACKIE’S office door opens and two of the establishment ‘52’ PICK-UPS’ enter and take positions beside the door as they escort AUDREY HORNE inside.

BLACKIE
Come in.

AUDREY walks inside wearing white lingerie decorated with little red print bows, white stockings and supporters, white shoes and a small, lacy coat.

Listening in on the conversation from the microphone planted on AGENT COOPER, we see DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL wearing headphones and seated around recording equipment. BIG ED is seated beside him in the van. We can hear the conversation between COOPER and JACQUES from the recording equipment.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Jacques, how long have you been dealing Black Jack?

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
Long enough to spot a card counter.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Do you always let card counters buy you a drink?

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
I don’t see tips like that every day.



CUT TO:

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

Seated at a small table in a corner of the casino, we see AGENT COOPER talking to JACQUES.

COOPER
Leo ever mention me to you?

Before he answers, JACQUES stares at a WAITRESS as she bends down towards them and then walks away.

JACQUES
I don’t know Mister. Who are you?

COOPER
I can’t believe Leo never told you about me.

JACQUES
Or maybe he did. I don’t know.

COOPER
Leo played you like a violin. Had you and your brother taking all the risk running the product across the border. Never cut you in on a piece of the action.

JACQUES
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

COOPER
Take that chip out of your pocket and take a look at it. Go ahead. That chip is a special significance. A very special night you spent up at your cabin. Here’s a clue.

COOPER mimics WALDO the mynah bird.

COOPER
Laura, Laura.

JACQUES remembers and quickly tries to leaves his seat. Being calm, COOPER holds JACQUES’S arm down to keep him from scampering away.

COOPER
Take it easy, take it easy. How do you think a low rent hump like Leo’s been financing this little operation.

JACQUES
You?

COOPER
I’m the bank.

JACQUES
He never mentioned your name.

COOPER
Of course not. Leo makes the buy with my cash. You and your brother mule it across theborder. Did he ever tell you who was distributing state-side?

JACQUES
Naw. Some high school kid. That’s all I know.

COOPER
That’s right. We’re in sync now Jacques can you feel it? Can you?

JACQUES grins.

JACQUES
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

COOPER
Good. Cause I got a job for you across the border tonight. No Leo. No middle man.

COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fold of cash.

COOPER
Its ten grand. Half now, half on completion. How’s that sound?

JACQUES snatches the wad of cash from COOPER’S hand.

JACQUES
Sounds good. What are we doing?

COOPER
You meet me at the water processing plant on Black Lake in two hours. Is that going to be a problem?

JACQUES
No, no problem.

COOPER
Good.

JACQUES downs the rest of his beer.

COOPER
One more question Jacques. You know, Leo told me all about that night up at the cabin with the girls. I’m curious about the chip. How’d that happen?

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

JACQUES LAUGHS slightly.

JACQUES
It was that crazy bird.

COOPER
Bird?

JACQUES
It had a thing for Laura. Saying her name all the time like he’s in love or something. So we’re all partying, girls are all getting pretty high, everybody’s pretty crazy.

COOPER
You, Laura and Ronette.

JACQUES
Leo lets Waldo out of the cage and the bird, he lands on her shoulder.

JACQUES LAUGHS.

JACQUES
Laura, she’s all tied up. Oh, she liked that. The bird, he starts pecking on her shoulder. Pecking like love pecks or something, ...

JACQUES LAUGHS again.

JACQUES
... you know what I mean. So Leo, he’s doing a number on her and Laura she’s screaming about that damn bird.

CLOSE ON: JACQUES MOUTH

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of JACQUES mouth as he speaks. The scene is SLOW-DOWNED.

JACQUES
So Leo takes out a chip puts it in her mouth and says bite the bullet baby, bite the bullet.

JACQUES LAUGHS.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER
Thanks for clearing that up.

JACQUES
Yeah, no problem.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

COOPER
See you on the other side.

From a viewpoint in the back seat, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY talk as they wait for JACQUES to fall into their trap. Through the front window, the factory surroundings are dark.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

ANDY
As we say in the law enforcement game, its a cold trail.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ahhhhhh women.

Over the police radio we hear DEPUTY HAWK.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)

SHERIFF TRUMAN picks up the microphone to reply.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

In the distance, a car drives up.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
He’s down stream about ten minutes. He’ll probably miss the catch but he’ll be there when we grill him.


BACK TO SCENE:

Directly ahead, the car comes to a stop and parks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Copy that. We’ll make our move as soon as the big fish shows his fins.

JACQUES RENAULT steps out of the car.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ready Andy?

ANDY
Ready Harry.

DISTANT VIEW POINT:

From a distance, TRUMAN’S police cruiser starts up and its police lights and siren turn on as it quickly accelerates. Another police cruiser, a backup unit, follows right behind them.


BIRD’S EVE VIEW:

We now get an OVERHEAD view as TRUMAN’S cruiser and the backup unit race toward JACQUES’S car. A third police cruiser, manned by DEPUTY FRED and DEPUTY #1, are also driving toward JACQUES’S car but opposite TRUMAN’S cruiser. Together they box JACQUES’S car in.


BACK TO SCENE:

Completely off guard, JACQUES spins around and attempts getting into his car but SHERIFF TRUMAN slams his brakes, jumps out of his cruiser, points his gun and yells.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
JACQUES! KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE ’EM! PUT ’EM ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR NOW!

FRED
YOU HEARD HIM!

DEPUTY #1
Cuff him!

DEPUTY FRED moves behind JACQUES to cuff him. SHERIFF TRUMAN puts his gun in its holster.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You’re under arrest ... for the attempted murder of Ronette Pulaski and the murder of Laura Palmer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN turns away from JACQUES and heads toward his police cruiser. DEPUTY FRED struggles with JACQUES to cuff his hands together.

FRED
Give me the other hand. Give me your other hand!

JACQUES throws his right elbow into FRED’s gut. JACQUES frees himself of FRED’s grip and reaches for the gun on FRED’s belt as he bends forward in pain. JACQUES grabs the gun, grips it with both hands and aims it toward SHERIFF TRUMAN.

FRED
HE’S GOT MY GUN!

DEPUTY #1
HARRY LOOK OUT!

SHERIFF TRUMAN spins around. A shot RINGS out. JACQUES RENAULT gets hit in the shoulder and falls to the ground. SHERIFF TRUMAN is stunned as he sees JACQUES fall. TRUMAN turns his head and sees ANDY forcibly poised as he points his gun toward JACQUES. DEPUTY HAWK and BIG ED have just arrived in the white van. HAWK rushes over to JACQUES.

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
My shoulder.

Stunned, TRUMAN stands blank faced.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Andy?

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
Better call an ambulance.

ANDY

In the background, DEPUTY HAWK stands next to JACQUES. BIG ED helps DEPUTY FRED.

HAWK
Shut up. You’re all right.

ANDY
Better call that ambulance.

HAWK
You have the right to remain silent.

Staring at ANDY, SHERIFF TRUMAN is still stunned.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

CUT TO:

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

We FOCUS on the reflection of a suitcase full of cash. A wrapped bundle of bills is thrown into the case. We ZOOM out to see HANK JENNINGS close the suitcase. We ZOOM out further to see JOSIE PACKARD leaning against the cabinet beside HANK.

HANK
Its all here. You’re very generous Josie. Sitting in that concrete box all that time, ninety grand seemed like all the money in creation. Kept me going. Its ... funniest thing, back in the world, I don’t know, ...

HANK lifts and bobs the suitcase up and down.

HANK
... it seems kinda’ light.

JOSIE
We had an agreement.

JOSIE walks away from HANK and over to the kitchen counter. JOSIE lights up a cigarette. HANK follows JOSIE to the counter.

HANK
Oh I’ve been going over this in my mind and ... see if you can follow my thinking. We’re all born into life and we have a certain number of years to move and breathe and have our vein. That’s from a book on oriental philosophy I read when I was in the joint. And maybe somebody, somewhere, knows how much time we have. I don’t, do you?

JOSIE blows her cigarette smoke into HANK’S face. HANK belligerently breathes it in deeply.

HANK
So, when a man gives up a certain portion of his life, eighteen months for instance. How does he place a value on that time? Eighteen months, ninety thousand, what’s that? Uh, five thousand a month. Well that’s not bad if you’re going to live another forty or fifty years but what if you only got another twenty or ten ... or some unforeseen event kills you tomorrow. As in the case of the boating accident that killed your late husband Andrew.

JOSIE moves into the living room. HANK follows her. In the background, behind HANK, is a deer head trophy. The horns of the trophy align with HANK’S head making it appear that the horns are sprouting from his head.

HANK
Or say, you just got out of prison. Where you went in for vehicular manslaughter as part of an agreement to avoid being implicated in the commission of a much greater crime, murder. For which in fact you were responsible. But now there’s this threat, this possible threat, that ... this fact could be discovered ... and in one stroke, ten or fifteen or twenty more years of your life could be cut right off from underneath you. So I’ve been asking myself. What does that do to the market value of eighteen months?

JOSIE turns around to face HANK.

JOSIE
We had an agreement.

She walks back to the kitchen counter. Again, HANK follows her.

MUSIC: HANK’S THEME     39K

HANK
And we still do sweetheart. Signed, sealed, delivered ... and I want to take care of everything we agreed to. You see, you want a lot for your money ... and I want a lot for my time. You know there’s a saying in the joint. Its not oriental philosophy but it has a similar kind of logic that appeals to my uh ...

JOSIE tries to walk away from him but HANK grabs her arms and turns her around to face him.

HANK
... spiritual nature.

HANK grabs JOSIE’S right hand and clasps her fingers with the fingers on his right hand with their thumbs sticking up.

HANK
Once you’re in business with somebody you’re in business for life, like a marriage.

Using his left hand, HANK pulls out a switch blade knife and clicks it open with a push of a button. HANK moves the blade to JOSIE’S thumb and gently slashes it. JOSIE writhes slightly in pain as blood oozes out of the cut. Next, HANK slashes his own thumb. HANK then presses his bleeding thumb against JOSIE’S.

HANK
Partner.

HANK releases his grip, moves his cut thumb to his mouth and licks the blood off with a smack. JOSIE trembles in fear. HANK walks off and leaves. JOSIE, still trembling, moves her thumb to her mouth and wipes the blood on her red lips.

From the open door of the office, two MILL WORKERS watch CATHERINE as she tosses the files around. PETE MARTELL walks up to the open office door to see what the commotion is all about. PETE throws a questioning glance to one of MILL WORKERS.

CATHERINE
Damn. Where? Where is it?

PETE steps into the office.

PETE

Holding files, CATHERINE turns to face PETE.

CATHERINE

PETE closes the door behind himself.

PETE
Well don’t you keep it in that little safe at home?

CATHERINE
No, its not in the safe at home. Its not here. Its not anywhere. Tell me you didn’t take it?

PETE shrugs.

PETE
I didn’t take it.

CATHERINE
Pete, tell me the truth. You’re not helping her to pull something here.

PETE notices that the two MILL WORKERS are still watching them. PETE moves to close the horizontal blind to the window they are using to peer inside.

Josie.

PETE
Oh no.

PETE moves to close another horizontal blind to a window that the two nosy MILL WORKERS have moved to.

PETE
Pull what here?

CATHERINE
Oh Peter. Forget everything that we’ve ever said or done to hurt each other.

PETE
Just like that.

PETE closes another horizontal blind.

PETE becomes tearyed eyed.

PETE
I know things haven’t been easy for ya’.

CATHERINE
Peter, somewhere under all that scar tissue there’s the faintest flicker of what we used to feel for each other. I’m asking you to feel that now.

PETE
Why? Exactly.

CATHERINE
(emotional) Because I’m in trouble ... and given what I’ve become and the way I’ve treated people there’s no one else I can turn to. I need your help.

PETE listens on with tears in his eyes. PETE rushes over to CATHERINE and gives her a big hug.

PETE
Oh Catherine. Catherine.

CATHERINE rolls her eyes and gently pats his back.

BIG ED
So, Fred starts to put the cuffs on him right. Now Harry, he turns to go. Now all of a sudden Jacques throws an elbow at Fred like this.

BIG ED visually shows the group the move JACQUES made.

BIG ED
Wham!

LUCY, with her back to group, is listening as she waters some plants in the reception area.

HAWK
And in one move he takes Fred’s gun and he’s got the drop on Harry.

BIG ED
Harry is deader then a pound of road side stew.

HAWK
Then, all of a sudden, a single shot rings out.

ANDY puts his hands to together with his index fingers pointed out to resemble a gun and reenacts his shooting of JACQUES. ANDY includes the sound effect of the gun firing, ‘Paa-kehhh’. BIG ED, DEPUTY HAWK and the surrounding DEPUTIES clap and cheer him on.

HAWK
All right! Andy the man.

LUCY turns to look at ANDY. Their eyes meet. LUCY smiles, shyly turns away and quickly scampers into the coffee station.

BIG ED
Alright Andy.

HAWK pushes ANDY to talk to LUCY.

HAWK
Go ahead Andy. Give it your best shot. Go on.

ANDY tugs his belt up and walks to the coffee station. LUCY turns her head to look at ANDY and quickly turns her head away. ANDY turns around and closes the accordion doors of the coffee station for privacy. ANDY turns to LUCY, grabs her by the arms and turns her around to face him. Slowly, they move to kiss. ANDY and LUCY both puts their arms around each other as they longingly kiss each other. Still holding each other, LUCY and ANDY separate from the kiss to look at each other.

LUCY
Oh Andy.

ANDY
Oh Punky.

LUCY
I’m pregnant.

ANDY’S eyes widen. He remains silent. LUCY becomes irritated by his silence and expression. ANDY opens the doors to the coffee station, slowly walks out and moves down the hall. BIG ED and HAWK watch ANDY silently walk off.

HAWK
Uh-oh.

Carrying a watering pitcher, LUCY exits the coffee station and walks by HAWK and BIG ED. Angry, LUCY stares at HAWK and BIG ED and barks.

LUCY
Fresh ... coffee.

LUCY walks to her office. BIG ED and HAWK shake their heads and walk away. We PAN to see the other DEPUTIES also walk off. We ZOOM in on the reception window to LUCY’S office. In her office, LUCY’S telephone RINGS. Annoyed, LUCY rudely answers it.

NORMA looks away from HANK.
